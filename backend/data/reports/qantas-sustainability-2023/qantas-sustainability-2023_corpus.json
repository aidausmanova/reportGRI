    "text": "This past year has seen the Qantas Group more than double the amount of flying compared to FY22, which is great for our customers and people.We know that brings with it a renewed focus on the steps the industry must take to reduce its impact on the environment.As our 2023 Sustainability Report details, this past year we took significant steps to support our long-term goal to decarbonise as we accelerate investment.Our fleet renewal program is the largest example of that.New, more fuel-efficient aircraft are one of the ways we will seek to achieve our interim goal of reducing net emissions by 25 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.During FY23 we received 10 new aircraft, and in the year ahead we'll receive another 14, including QantasLink's first Airbus A220 aircraft, which uses 25 per cent less fuel than the aircraft it replaces.During the year we also built on our existing partnership with Airbus to establish a $400 million Climate Fund, which we're using to accelerate the development of an Australian SAF industry and ensure access to high-integrity carbon offsets.We've already made our first investments in SAF - one in Queensland and another in Western Australia, both with partners - and have more in the pipeline.We're also increasing investment in our workforce to support both our future needs and that of the wider industry.We\u00a0expect to create 8,500 new highly skilled jobs in Australia over the next decade and that's going to require a significant investment in training.As part of this commitment, we announced a new Engineering Academy that will help us develop a more diverse pipeline of talent in a traditionally male-dominated area.We also nearly doubled the size of our Pilot Academy scholarship program for women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders with 50\u00a0places over five years.Construction has begun on a new flight training centre in Sydney that will enable training for up to 4,500 Qantas and Jetstar pilots and cabin crew each year.Sustainability is also about ensuring we help support and sustain the communities that we serve, which is why the Qantas Group has a long history of supporting wider social issues that impact our people and customers.This includes Indigenous reconciliation, which we have supported for many years.We've been promoting First Nations culture and tourism since the 1960s.We supported constitutional recognition in 2014 and the Uluru Statement of the Heart in 2019.And that continues with our support for the Yes campaign in this year's referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.As an airline founded in outback Queensland more than a century ago, we're proud of the Group's longstanding commitment to regional Australia.Our Regional Grants program, which was paused during COVID-19, returned this year and doubled in value.We had a record number of entries and made grants to 32 organisations across Australia.As part of our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we also released our first Access and Inclusion Plan so that we can continue to improve the experience for people with disability who choose to fly or work with us.While there has been good progress on sustainability goals over the past 12 months, we also acknowledge shortcomings in how we have served our stakeholders.We know there is much more to be done and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.RICHARD GOYDER AOJuly 2022Jetstar marks arrival of\u00a0first NEO 1",

rights.For the Qantas Group, this means seeking to act in a way that avoids harm, or infringing on the rights of other people, whether they are employees, customers, workers in our supply chain, or the broader community.It includes taking action consistent with the UNGPs to address any adverse impacts in which we may be involved, or connected, and to proactively look for ways to advance the respect of human rights through our business activities.During FY23, we released an updated First Nations Strategy for the Qantas Group.Its vision is to create a shared national identity that celebrates the knowledge and cultures of First\u00a0Nations people.This vision will be accomplished through the social, economic and cultural inclusion of First Nations people across the Qantas Group, and realised through four key focus areas:- -Providing meaningful careers- -Diversifying our supplier base and spend- -Amplifying First Nations experiences and culture through our customer journey- -Strengthening our reconciliation journey through community engagements.We engaged the services of specialist First Nations consultancy, 15 Times Better, to complete a comprehensive review of the Qantas Group's First Nations engagement activity.This resulted in the development of an overarching Qantas Group First Nations Engagement Strategy that will guide our First Nations-focused activities across Qantas, Jetstar, Qantas Freight and Qantas Loyalty businesses.During FY23, we established the Qantas Internal First Nations Advisory Council which is chaired by the CEO of Jetstar, Stephanie Tully.It is made up of representatives from across the Group with representation from Qantas' First\u00a0Nations\u00a0employees.We also relaunched our First Nations employee network, Daramu, in FY23.Its vision is to create a safe community for First Nations people and allies to grow, connect, yarn, learn and celebrate First Nations culture across the Qantas Group.During the year, employee Fran Grant was appointed Chair of the Daramu Committee.Fran is a Yuin woman and her Aboriginal family comes from the New South Wales South Coast.She is the child of a Stolen Child, which carries great responsibility amongst her family and community.Fran also works as a Customer Service Agent at Sydney International\u00a0Terminal.",

Total direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.Scope 1 emissions include aviation fuel and other fuels and gases from both domestic and international operations.For domestic emissions, the Qantas Group applies the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Measurement Determination factors and methodology.For international emissions, the Qantas Group applies International CORSIA factors and methodology.The Qantas Group is a CORSIA participant and aligns international emissions disclosure with the CORSIA regulatory framework.All emissions are reported as CO2 equivalent (CO2-e).CH4 and N2O have been applied to all emissions per their NGER Measurement Determination factors.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group.FY23 data excludes SAF derived CO2-e emission abatement.- 15.   Total indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.Scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity.The Qantas Group applies the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination factors for the calculation of CO2-e, except for Tri-Generation associated emissions where the Qantas Group applies a facility-specific emission factor.Emission factors for the consumption of purchased electricity from the grid are updated annually to reflect changes in energy mix.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group.- 16.   Total indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from value chain activities (Scope 3) measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.Scope 3 emissions inclusions are informed by the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting &amp; Reporting Standard and Australian Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard.Upstream fuel-related activities (e.g.extraction and refining) and food and beverage-related purchased goods make up the majority of total scope 3 emissions.The Qantas Group reports on Scope 3 indirect emissions of material relevance.The Qantas Group also offsets all employee and contractor business travel under our Fly Carbon Neutral program, therefore all business travel emissions are excluded from our emissions profile to prevent double counting.Where possible, the Qantas Group is informed by the Australian Government's Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Products and Services to determine our Scope 3 emissions using National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA) emissions factors for the calculation of CO2-e.The increase in Scope 3 emissions for FY22 is a result of an increase in fuel consumption and a change in the Scope 3 emissions factor relating to transport fuels.Scope 3 emissions have been restated for FY20 to FY22 to include emissions from jet fuel attributed to the Group's Freight operations.- 17.T otal Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.The data has been restated for FY20 to FY22 to include the restated Scope 3 emissions from jet fuel attributed to the Group's Freight\u00a0operations.- 18.   Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from domestic operations.Domestic operations include all emissions from activities reported under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination.- 19.   Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from international operations.International operations include all emissions from international aviation fuel consumption.- 20.  Greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2 only) intensity measured in kilograms of CO2-e per 100 revenue-tonne-kilometres (RTKs) converted to CO2-e tonnes by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination factors.The\u00a0previously reported figures have been restated.The restatement applies an improved L/100RTK calculation methodology consistently across all financial years back to FY20.Scope: All flights operated solely for the purpose of the Qantas Group, and all activities under the control of the Qantas Group.- 21.   The total volume of aviation kerosene consumed by the Qantas Group's flying businesses from 1 July to 30 June.Scope: Aviation fuel consumption where the flight is operated solely for the purpose of the Qantas Group.This includes both domestic and international operations: Qantas Airways, Jetstar Australia and New Zealand, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Qantas Freight.This does not include aviation fuel consumed by Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan or codeshare partners.- 22.  Fuel per 100 revenue-tonne-kilometres (RTKs).The amount of revenue-generating payload carried for the distance flown.The total number of tonnes of paying passengers, freight and mail carried, multiplied by the number of kilometres flown.The\u00a0previously reported figures have been restated.The restatement applies an improved L/100RTK calculation methodology consistently across all financial years back to FY20.Scope: Fuel per 100 RTKs includes domestic and international passenger/ freight operations (Qantas Airways, Jetstar Australia and New Zealand, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Qantas Freight including Jets trucking).- 23.  SAF uptake represents how much SAF was purchased by the Qantas Group and delivered to the relevant airport fuelling infrastructure utilising a book and claim methodology.- 24.  The total amount of electricity consumed as measured in megawatt hours (MWh), natural gas measured in gigajoules (GJ) and diesel measured in litres (L) were separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned entities within Australia for the period 1 July to 30\u00a0June.The figure reported for FY22 has been restated to take into account accruals for the period.- 25.  Total onshore waste to landfill (including quarantine waste) or recycled measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.This includes all waste collected onshore and delivered from Qantas Group premises directly to landfill or recycling facilities where the Qantas Group is responsible for the collection and management of waste and is separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned enterprises by a waste service provider or third party, or where data directly attributed to Qantas is provided.Where Qantas Group has not been separately billed and can reasonably influence waste management procedures, as in the case of inflight waste, an estimated process was applied based on prorated waste generated.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).- 26.  Water consumption is measured in kilolitres ('000 L) for the period 1 July to 30 June, separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned onshore entities.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).The figure reported for FY22 was restated to take into account actual accruals for the period.- 27.  Average fleet age: The Group's scheduled passenger fleet including both owned and leased aircraft.The Qantas Group's scheduled passenger fleet does not include dedicated freighters, wet-lease aircraft and Network Aviation F100 fleet.The average fleet age in the FY22 report included the Network Aviation F100 fleet in error, and so has been restated here to remain consistent with the long term approach to calculating this figure.As a result, the previously stated figure of 14.7 for FY22 (which included the F100s) has been adjusted to 13.8 (which excludes the F100s).",
