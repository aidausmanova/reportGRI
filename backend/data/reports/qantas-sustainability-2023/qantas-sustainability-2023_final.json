The total amount of electricity consumed as measured in megawatt hours (MWh), natural gas measured in gigajoules (GJ) and diesel measured in litres (L) were separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned entities within Australia for the period 1 July to 30\u00a0June.The figure reported for FY22 has been restated to take into account accruals for the period.- 25.  Total onshore waste to landfill (including quarantine waste) or recycled measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.This includes all waste collected onshore and delivered from Qantas Group premises directly to landfill or recycling facilities where the Qantas Group is responsible for the collection and management of waste and is separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned enterprises by a waste service provider or third party, or where data directly attributed to Qantas is provided.Where Qantas Group has not been separately billed and can reasonably influence waste management procedures, as in the case of inflight waste, an estimated process was applied based on prorated waste generated.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).- 26.  Water consumption is measured in kilolitres ('000 L) for the period 1 July to 30 June, separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned onshore entities.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).The figure reported for FY22 was restated to take into account actual accruals for the period.- 27.  Average fleet age: The Group's scheduled passenger fleet including both owned and leased aircraft.The Qantas Group's scheduled passenger fleet does not include dedicated freighters, wet-lease aircraft and Network Aviation F100 fleet.The average fleet age in the FY22 report included the Network Aviation F100 fleet in error, and so has been restated here to remain consistent with the long term approach to calculating this figure.As a result, the previously stated figure of 14.7 for FY22 (which included the F100s) has been adjusted to 13.8 (which excludes the F100s)."

Total onshore waste to landfill (including quarantine waste) or recycled measured in tonnes for the period 1 July to 30 June.This includes all waste collected onshore and delivered from Qantas Group premises directly to landfill or recycling facilities where the Qantas Group is responsible for the collection and management of waste and is separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned enterprises by a waste service provider or third party, or where data directly attributed to Qantas is provided.Where Qantas Group has not been separately billed and can reasonably influence waste management procedures, as in the case of inflight waste, an estimated process was applied based on prorated waste generated.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).- 26.  Water consumption is measured in kilolitres ('000 L) for the period 1 July to 30 June, separately billed to Qantas wholly-owned onshore entities.Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group (excludes Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific).The figure reported for FY22 was restated to take into account actual accruals for the period.- 27.  Average fleet age: The Group's scheduled passenger fleet including both owned and leased aircraft.The Qantas Group's scheduled passenger fleet does not include dedicated freighters, wet-lease aircraft and Network Aviation F100 fleet.The average fleet age in the FY22 report included the Network Aviation F100 fleet in error, and so has been restated here to remain consistent with the long term approach to calculating this figure.As a result, the previously stated figure of 14.7 for FY22 (which included the F100s) has been adjusted to 13.8 (which excludes the F100s)."

                "text": "We recognise that human-induced climate change is a significant issue for the aviation industry.We are committed to supporting the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement to limit warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.In 2019, we were one of the first airlines in the world to announce our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 1 and capping our net emissions at 2019 levels.In March 2022, we released our CAP which details our climate change targets and how we plan to meet them.Qantas supports the TCFD and details on how we align with its recommendations can be found in\u00a0the Report appendix.We recognise the impact waste has on the environment and as a Group we are committed to addressing this impact through waste reduction projects, innovation and improved waste\u00a0management.The Group's ambition is to have zero single-use plastics across our operations by 2027 1  and zero onshore waste to landfill by 2030 2 .A robust governance structure has been established to drive the delivery of Project Bowerbird, the Group's waste reduction strategy, and accelerate the implementation of initiatives.This includes establishing an Executive Steering Committee and Business Unit Working Groups to monitor progress against targets and manage any roadblocks.We are working with our suppliers to increase the use of recycled and renewable materials and considering the environmental impact in the design phase of our products.For example, each of our premium economy blankets are made with 20 recycled plastic bottles, our water bottles are 100 per cent recycled PET and we have introduced pens made of wheat straw and kraft paper onboard our aircraft.Since 2011, the Qantas Group has been a signatory to the Australian Packaging Covenant, working to improve the sustainability of the packaging we use through product reviews, product substitution to recyclable or compostable alternatives and increasing the use of recycled content.The Group is committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights.At a minimum, we\u00a0comply with all applicable national and international laws and where national laws conflict with international standards, we seek opportunities to adopt the higher standard.We also uphold the International Labour Organisation Core Labour Standards and voluntarily commit to conduct our business in line with the standards of the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).Since 2017, we have been a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC), whereby we have committed to incorporating the Ten Principles of the UNGC on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, in our strategies, policies and procedures, supporting us to uphold our corporate responsibilities to safeguard people and planet.We recognise that our corporate responsibility to respect human rights goes beyond public statements of commitment and extends to the actions we take to demonstrate our respect for human rights.For the Qantas Group, this means seeking to act in a way that avoids harm, or infringing on the rights of other people, whether they are employees, customers, workers in our supply chain, or the broader community.It includes taking action consistent with the UNGPs to address any adverse impacts in which we may be involved, or connected, and to proactively look for ways to advance the respect of human rights through our business activities.During FY23, we released an updated First Nations Strategy for the Qantas Group.Its vision is to create a shared national identity that celebrates the knowledge and cultures of First\u00a0Nations people.This vision will be accomplished through the social, economic and cultural inclusion of First Nations people across the Qantas Group, and realised through four key focus areas:- -Providing meaningful careers- -Diversifying our supplier base and spend- -Amplifying First Nations experiences and culture through our customer journey- -Strengthening our reconciliation journey through community engagements.We engaged the services of specialist First Nations consultancy, 15 Times Better, to complete a comprehensive review of the Qantas Group's First Nations engagement activity.This resulted in the development of an overarching Qantas Group First Nations Engagement Strategy that will guide our First Nations-focused activities across Qantas, Jetstar, Qantas Freight and Qantas Loyalty businesses.During FY23, we established the Qantas Internal First Nations Advisory Council which is chaired by the CEO of Jetstar, Stephanie Tully.It is made up of representatives from across the Group with representation from Qantas' First\u00a0Nations\u00a0employees.We also relaunched our First Nations employee network, Daramu, in FY23.Its vision is to create a safe community for First Nations people and allies to grow, connect, yarn, learn and celebrate First Nations culture across the Qantas Group.During the year, employee Fran Grant was appointed Chair of the Daramu Committee.Fran is a Yuin woman and her Aboriginal family comes from the New South Wales South Coast.She is the child of a Stolen Child, which carries great responsibility amongst her family and community.Fran also works as a Customer Service Agent at Sydney International\u00a0Terminal."
