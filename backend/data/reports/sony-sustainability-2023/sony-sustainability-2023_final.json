Values while implementing DE&amp;I initiatives based on its People Philosophy, 'Special You, Diverse Sony,' as well as the Sony Group Diversity Statement.Sony maintains operations in countries and regions around the world, hiring employees with high potential who best meet local needs.Approximately half of all Sony Group employees are engaged in business activities outside Japan, and more than 90% of these employees are locally hired.Sony aims to globally promote greater opportunities for women as part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive work environment in which diverse employees can play an active role.As of March 31, 2023, the ratio of women to men in the workforce was 34.0% and the ratio of women to men in management positions was 30.0% at the whole Sony Group.Additionally, Sony considers increasing gender diversity as an area of focus for Japan, where the ratio of women to men in management positions is low and the number of women majoring in the fields of science or engineering is limited.Sony also hires and provides workplace support for individuals with disabilities.Beyond complying with the laws, rules, and regulations of each nation and region in which it operates, Sony is devoted to creating inclusive workplaces where all employees, regardless of disability, can build careers.The Sony Group as a whole endeavors to increase the accessibility of its products and services, and undertakes initiatives related to diversity and social justice.In 2020, the Group established the 100 million USD 'Global Social Justice Fund' to provide support to organizations advocating for social justice and human rights, and promote DE&amp;I initiatives worldwide.In April 2023, Sony made changes to its organizational structure to strengthen such initiatives across the group, newly appointing the Senior Executive in charge of Lead of Group DE&amp;I and the Senior Vice President in charge of Group DE&amp;I Promotion.By further evolving Sony's DE&amp;I initiatives, Sony promotes diversity, the source of innovation, creating new value that leads to both the growth of the Sony Group and the development of society.Sony's policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct.Sony expects all Sony group companies to practice  responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with the Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.Under this policy, Sony established and implemented group policies specific to the human rights area, such as 'Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct' which sets forth the code of conduct for Sony's own manufacturing sites and suppliers, and aims to work towards a responsible supply chain, and 'Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,' which guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&amp;D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms.Sony engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in line with the frameworks set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.As one of our major efforts, Sony conducts human rights risk impact assessments, which serve as the starting point for human rights due diligence.After identifying potential human rights risks that are highly relevant to Sony's business activities, the assessments further identified three areas as priority areas for enhancing initiatives throughout the Sony Group: responsible supply chains; respect for diversity, equity and inclusion and responsible development; and use of technologies.As a result of the assessments, Sony promotes individual initiatives for each of these areas.For example, an overview of Sony's efforts in the area of 'Responsible Supply Chain' are as follows:- \u00b7 Implements the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct which adopts RBA Code of Conduct, industry best practice for achieving a responsible supply chain to our own electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers, then continue to respond to human rights, labor, safety or environmental issues throughout the supply chain.- \u00b7 Checks compliance status annually for our own manufacturing sites, and at the start of business and regularly thereafter with OEM/ODM, raw materials and parts suppliers depending on level of risk and size of business.- \u00b7 As a result of the above assessments, Sony requests improvements from manufacturing sites and suppliers that were determined to require corrective measures, and provides support and monitoring until the completion of improvements.As the environment continues to change rapidly and substantially worldwide, social and environmental problems are increasing in gravity.Sony believes that it is essential to contribute to the solving of such problems through the application of technology.To that end, Sony supports technological development that helps businesses grow, along with innovation that betters society and industry for the future.In 2022 Sony established its R&amp;D mission: 'Push our civilization forward and make this planet sustainable.' To help facilitate this, the company conducts research and development in businesses and fields where it can enrich people's lives, shape social infrastructure, and make significant contributions to sustainability.Sony's research and development is underway, for example, on sensing technology that measures the water content in soil, ultra-wide-area communication network technology, and predictive data analytics technology based on captured data.Sony has combined these technologies to build Sony's Earth MIMAMORI platform aiming to help predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters and contribute to solve environmental concerns.The intelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionality helps to raise efficiency and productivity in society, such as by realizing smart cities and factories.The IMX500 processes data inside the sensor itself, and is capable of extracting only necessary data.In transmitting a 4K image to the cloud, for example, it can reduce the volume of data to one-7,400th of what the average digital camera transmits, helping to reduce energy consumption and communication costs.Sony will continue to develop and offer solutions to create value for society by applying its technologies in partnership with other companies.Sensing technologyNetwork technologyPredictive data analyticsIntelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionalitySmart city trial project in Rome, Italy, using the intelligent vision sensor IMX500Sony's SustainabilityBusiness OverviewEditorial PolicyAt a Glance 2022The Sony Group Code of Conduct Approach to SustainabilitySony's Purpose &amp; Values"

                "text": "Sony has been implementing a variety of initiatives to combat global warming since 1970s.In 2010 Sony announced Road to Zero, a global environmental plan to achieve a zero environmental footprint by 2050.From the standpoint of the designated priority area of climate change, Sony set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero for its products and business activities throughout their entire life cycles, and to this end each business segment is implementing its own action plan.As climate change risks become more apparent and serious worldwide, the transition to a decarbonized society has become an urgent issue.Sony made the decision in 2022 to accelerate its goal of achieving net-zero targets throughout the entire value chain, including scopes 1 to 3, by ten years from 2050 to 2040, and to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations net-zero status by 2030.Sony has also announced its plan to accelerate the target for achieving 100% renewable electricity in its own operations by ten years, from 2040 to 2030.To achieve these goals, we work to promote energy conservation and introduce renewable energy at our sites around the world, while also encouraging our business partners who engage in parts, materials and finished product manufacturing to reduce their own GHG emissions.Furthermore, we provide energy-saving products, services and solutions for a wide range of business areas, and actively invest in startups that work to create next-generation environmental technologies to further contribute to the decarbonization of society as a whole.Going forward, Sony will continue to further accelerate efforts to address climate change by accepting responsibility to aim for zero greenhouse gas emissions and making contributions through its diverse technologies and businesses.Sony works to bring value to society from the standpoint of its Purpose &amp; Values while implementing DE&amp;I initiatives based on its People Philosophy, 'Special You, Diverse Sony,' as well as the Sony Group Diversity Statement.Sony maintains operations in countries and regions around the world, hiring employees with high potential who best meet local needs.Approximately half of all Sony Group employees are engaged in business activities outside Japan, and more than 90% of these employees are locally hired.Sony aims to globally promote greater opportunities for women as part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive work environment in which diverse employees can play an active role.As of March 31, 2023, the ratio of women to men in the workforce was 34.0% and the ratio of women to men in management positions was 30.0% at the whole Sony Group.Additionally, Sony considers increasing gender diversity as an area of focus for Japan, where the ratio of women to men in management positions is low and the number of women majoring in the fields of science or engineering is limited.Sony also hires and provides workplace support for individuals with disabilities.Beyond complying with the laws, rules, and regulations of each nation and region in which it operates, Sony is devoted to creating inclusive workplaces where all employees, regardless of disability, can build careers.The Sony Group as a whole endeavors to increase the accessibility of its products and services, and undertakes initiatives related to diversity and social justice.In 2020, the Group established the 100 million USD 'Global Social Justice Fund' to provide support to organizations advocating for social justice and human rights, and promote DE&amp;I initiatives worldwide.In April 2023, Sony made changes to its organizational structure to strengthen such initiatives across the group, newly appointing the Senior Executive in charge of Lead of Group DE&amp;I and the Senior Vice President in charge of Group DE&amp;I Promotion.By further evolving Sony's DE&amp;I initiatives, Sony promotes diversity, the source of innovation, creating new value that leads to both the growth of the Sony Group and the development of society.Sony's policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct.Sony expects all Sony group companies to practice  responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with the Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.Under this policy, Sony established and implemented group policies specific to the human rights area, such as 'Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct' which sets forth the code of conduct for Sony's own manufacturing sites and suppliers, and aims to work towards a responsible supply chain, and 'Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,' which guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&amp;D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms.Sony engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in line with the frameworks set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.As one of our major efforts, Sony conducts human rights risk impact assessments, which serve as the starting point for human rights due diligence.After identifying potential human rights risks that are highly relevant to Sony's business activities, the assessments further identified three areas as priority areas for enhancing initiatives throughout the Sony Group: responsible supply chains; respect for diversity, equity and inclusion and responsible development; and use of technologies.As a result of the assessments, Sony promotes individual initiatives for each of these areas.For example, an overview of Sony's efforts in the area of 'Responsible Supply Chain' are as follows:- \u00b7 Implements the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct which adopts RBA Code of Conduct, industry best practice for achieving a responsible supply chain to our own electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers, then continue to respond to human rights, labor, safety or environmental issues throughout the supply chain.- \u00b7 Checks compliance status annually for our own manufacturing sites, and at the start of business and regularly thereafter with OEM/ODM, raw materials and parts suppliers depending on level of risk and size of business.- \u00b7 As a result of the above assessments, Sony requests improvements from manufacturing sites and suppliers that were determined to require corrective measures, and provides support and monitoring until the completion of improvements.As the environment continues to change rapidly and substantially worldwide, social and environmental problems are increasing in gravity.Sony believes that it is essential to contribute to the solving of such problems through the application of technology.To that end, Sony supports technological development that helps businesses grow, along with innovation that betters society and industry for the future.In 2022 Sony established its R&amp;D mission: 'Push our civilization forward and make this planet sustainable.' To help facilitate this, the company conducts research and development in businesses and fields where it can enrich people's lives, shape social infrastructure, and make significant contributions to sustainability.Sony's research and development is underway, for example, on sensing technology that measures the water content in soil, ultra-wide-area communication network technology, and predictive data analytics technology based on captured data.Sony has combined these technologies to build Sony's Earth MIMAMORI platform aiming to help predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters and contribute to solve environmental concerns.The intelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionality helps to raise efficiency and productivity in society, such as by realizing smart cities and factories.The IMX500 processes data inside the sensor itself, and is capable of extracting only necessary data.In transmitting a 4K image to the cloud, for example, it can reduce the volume of data to one-7,400th of what the average digital camera transmits, helping to reduce energy consumption and communication costs.Sony will continue to develop and offer solutions to create value for society by applying its technologies in partnership with other companies.Sensing technologyNetwork technologyPredictive data analyticsIntelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionalitySmart city trial project in Rome, Italy, using the intelligent vision sensor IMX500Sony's SustainabilityBusiness OverviewEditorial PolicyAt a Glance 2022The Sony Group Code of Conduct Approach to SustainabilitySony's Purpose &amp; Values"

                "text": "Sony has been implementing a variety of initiatives to combat global warming since 1970s.In 2010 Sony announced Road to Zero, a global environmental plan to achieve a zero environmental footprint by 2050.From the standpoint of the designated priority area of climate change, Sony set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero for its products and business activities throughout their entire life cycles, and to this end each business segment is implementing its own action plan.As climate change risks become more apparent and serious worldwide, the transition to a decarbonized society has become an urgent issue.Sony made the decision in 2022 to accelerate its goal of achieving net-zero targets throughout the entire value chain, including scopes 1 to 3, by ten years from 2050 to 2040, and to make direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2) of its own operations net-zero status by 2030.Sony has also announced its plan to accelerate the target for achieving 100% renewable electricity in its own operations by ten years, from 2040 to 2030.To achieve these goals, we work to promote energy conservation and introduce renewable energy at our sites around the world, while also encouraging our business partners who engage in parts, materials and finished product manufacturing to reduce their own GHG emissions.Furthermore, we provide energy-saving products, services and solutions for a wide range of business areas, and actively invest in startups that work to create next-generation environmental technologies to further contribute to the decarbonization of society as a whole.Going forward, Sony will continue to further accelerate efforts to address climate change by accepting responsibility to aim for zero greenhouse gas emissions and making contributions through its diverse technologies and businesses.Sony works to bring value to society from the standpoint of its Purpose &amp; Values while implementing DE&amp;I initiatives based on its People Philosophy, 'Special You, Diverse Sony,' as well as the Sony Group Diversity Statement.Sony maintains operations in countries and regions around the world, hiring employees with high potential who best meet local needs.Approximately half of all Sony Group employees are engaged in business activities outside Japan, and more than 90% of these employees are locally hired.Sony aims to globally promote greater opportunities for women as part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive work environment in which diverse employees can play an active role.As of March 31, 2023, the ratio of women to men in the workforce was 34.0% and the ratio of women to men in management positions was 30.0% at the whole Sony Group.Additionally, Sony considers increasing gender diversity as an area of focus for Japan, where the ratio of women to men in management positions is low and the number of women majoring in the fields of science or engineering is limited.Sony also hires and provides workplace support for individuals with disabilities.Beyond complying with the laws, rules, and regulations of each nation and region in which it operates, Sony is devoted to creating inclusive workplaces where all employees, regardless of disability, can build careers.The Sony Group as a whole endeavors to increase the accessibility of its products and services, and undertakes initiatives related to diversity and social justice.In 2020, the Group established the 100 million USD 'Global Social Justice Fund' to provide support to organizations advocating for social justice and human rights, and promote DE&amp;I initiatives worldwide.In April 2023, Sony made changes to its organizational structure to strengthen such initiatives across the group, newly appointing the Senior Executive in charge of Lead of Group DE&amp;I and the Senior Vice President in charge of Group DE&amp;I Promotion.By further evolving Sony's DE&amp;I initiatives, Sony promotes diversity, the source of innovation, creating new value that leads to both the growth of the Sony Group and the development of society.Sony's policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct.Sony expects all Sony group companies to practice  responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with the Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.Under this policy, Sony established and implemented group policies specific to the human rights area, such as 'Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct' which sets forth the code of conduct for Sony's own manufacturing sites and suppliers, and aims to work towards a responsible supply chain, and 'Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,' which guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&amp;D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms.Sony engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in line with the frameworks set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.As one of our major efforts, Sony conducts human rights risk impact assessments, which serve as the starting point for human rights due diligence.After identifying potential human rights risks that are highly relevant to Sony's business activities, the assessments further identified three areas as priority areas for enhancing initiatives throughout the Sony Group: responsible supply chains; respect for diversity, equity and inclusion and responsible development; and use of technologies.As a result of the assessments, Sony promotes individual initiatives for each of these areas.For example, an overview of Sony's efforts in the area of 'Responsible Supply Chain' are as follows:- \u00b7 Implements the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct which adopts RBA Code of Conduct, industry best practice for achieving a responsible supply chain to our own electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers, then continue to respond to human rights, labor, safety or environmental issues throughout the supply chain.- \u00b7 Checks compliance status annually for our own manufacturing sites, and at the start of business and regularly thereafter with OEM/ODM, raw materials and parts suppliers depending on level of risk and size of business.- \u00b7 As a result of the above assessments, Sony requests improvements from manufacturing sites and suppliers that were determined to require corrective measures, and provides support and monitoring until the completion of improvements.As the environment continues to change rapidly and substantially worldwide, social and environmental problems are increasing in gravity.Sony believes that it is essential to contribute to the solving of such problems through the application of technology.To that end, Sony supports technological development that helps businesses grow, along with innovation that betters society and industry for the future.In 2022 Sony established its R&amp;D mission: 'Push our civilization forward and make this planet sustainable.' To help facilitate this, the company conducts research and development in businesses and fields where it can enrich people's lives, shape social infrastructure, and make significant contributions to sustainability.Sony's research and development is underway, for example, on sensing technology that measures the water content in soil, ultra-wide-area communication network technology, and predictive data analytics technology based on captured data.Sony has combined these technologies to build Sony's Earth MIMAMORI platform aiming to help predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters and contribute to solve environmental concerns.The intelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionality helps to raise efficiency and productivity in society, such as by realizing smart cities and factories.The IMX500 processes data inside the sensor itself, and is capable of extracting only necessary data.In transmitting a 4K image to the cloud, for example, it can reduce the volume of data to one-7,400th of what the average digital camera transmits, helping to reduce energy consumption and communication costs.Sony will continue to develop and offer solutions to create value for society by applying its technologies in partnership with other companies.Sensing technologyNetwork technologyPredictive data analyticsIntelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionalitySmart city trial project in Rome, Italy, using the intelligent vision sensor IMX500Sony's SustainabilityBusiness OverviewEditorial PolicyAt a Glance 2022The Sony Group Code of Conduct Approach to SustainabilitySony's Purpose &amp; Values"

Values while implementing DE&amp;I initiatives based on its People Philosophy, 'Special You, Diverse Sony,' as well as the Sony Group Diversity Statement.Sony maintains operations in countries and regions around the world, hiring employees with high potential who best meet local needs.Approximately half of all Sony Group employees are engaged in business activities outside Japan, and more than 90% of these employees are locally hired.Sony aims to globally promote greater opportunities for women as part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive work environment in which diverse employees can play an active role.As of March 31, 2023, the ratio of women to men in the workforce was 34.0% and the ratio of women to men in management positions was 30.0% at the whole Sony Group.Additionally, Sony considers increasing gender diversity as an area of focus for Japan, where the ratio of women to men in management positions is low and the number of women majoring in the fields of science or engineering is limited.Sony also hires and provides workplace support for individuals with disabilities.Beyond complying with the laws, rules, and regulations of each nation and region in which it operates, Sony is devoted to creating inclusive workplaces where all employees, regardless of disability, can build careers.The Sony Group as a whole endeavors to increase the accessibility of its products and services, and undertakes initiatives related to diversity and social justice.In 2020, the Group established the 100 million USD 'Global Social Justice Fund' to provide support to organizations advocating for social justice and human rights, and promote DE&amp;I initiatives worldwide.In April 2023, Sony made changes to its organizational structure to strengthen such initiatives across the group, newly appointing the Senior Executive in charge of Lead of Group DE&amp;I and the Senior Vice President in charge of Group DE&amp;I Promotion.By further evolving Sony's DE&amp;I initiatives, Sony promotes diversity, the source of innovation, creating new value that leads to both the growth of the Sony Group and the development of society.Sony's policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct.Sony expects all Sony group companies to practice  responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with the Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.Under this policy, Sony established and implemented group policies specific to the human rights area, such as 'Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct' which sets forth the code of conduct for Sony's own manufacturing sites and suppliers, and aims to work towards a responsible supply chain, and 'Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,' which guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&amp;D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms.Sony engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in line with the frameworks set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.As one of our major efforts, Sony conducts human rights risk impact assessments, which serve as the starting point for human rights due diligence.After identifying potential human rights risks that are highly relevant to Sony's business activities, the assessments further identified three areas as priority areas for enhancing initiatives throughout the Sony Group: responsible supply chains; respect for diversity, equity and inclusion and responsible development; and use of technologies.As a result of the assessments, Sony promotes individual initiatives for each of these areas.For example, an overview of Sony's efforts in the area of 'Responsible Supply Chain' are as follows:- \u00b7 Implements the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct which adopts RBA Code of Conduct, industry best practice for achieving a responsible supply chain to our own electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers, then continue to respond to human rights, labor, safety or environmental issues throughout the supply chain.- \u00b7 Checks compliance status annually for our own manufacturing sites, and at the start of business and regularly thereafter with OEM/ODM, raw materials and parts suppliers depending on level of risk and size of business.- \u00b7 As a result of the above assessments, Sony requests improvements from manufacturing sites and suppliers that were determined to require corrective measures, and provides support and monitoring until the completion of improvements.As the environment continues to change rapidly and substantially worldwide, social and environmental problems are increasing in gravity.Sony believes that it is essential to contribute to the solving of such problems through the application of technology.To that end, Sony supports technological development that helps businesses grow, along with innovation that betters society and industry for the future.In 2022 Sony established its R&amp;D mission: 'Push our civilization forward and make this planet sustainable.' To help facilitate this, the company conducts research and development in businesses and fields where it can enrich people's lives, shape social infrastructure, and make significant contributions to sustainability.Sony's research and development is underway, for example, on sensing technology that measures the water content in soil, ultra-wide-area communication network technology, and predictive data analytics technology based on captured data.Sony has combined these technologies to build Sony's Earth MIMAMORI platform aiming to help predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters and contribute to solve environmental concerns.The intelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionality helps to raise efficiency and productivity in society, such as by realizing smart cities and factories.The IMX500 processes data inside the sensor itself, and is capable of extracting only necessary data.In transmitting a 4K image to the cloud, for example, it can reduce the volume of data to one-7,400th of what the average digital camera transmits, helping to reduce energy consumption and communication costs.Sony will continue to develop and offer solutions to create value for society by applying its technologies in partnership with other companies.Sensing technologyNetwork technologyPredictive data analyticsIntelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionalitySmart city trial project in Rome, Italy, using the intelligent vision sensor IMX500Sony's SustainabilityBusiness OverviewEditorial PolicyAt a Glance 2022The Sony Group Code of Conduct Approach to SustainabilitySony's Purpose &amp; Values"
