Values while implementing DE&amp;I initiatives based on its People Philosophy, 'Special You, Diverse Sony,' as well as the Sony Group Diversity Statement.Sony maintains operations in countries and regions around the world, hiring employees with high potential who best meet local needs.Approximately half of all Sony Group employees are engaged in business activities outside Japan, and more than 90% of these employees are locally hired.Sony aims to globally promote greater opportunities for women as part of our efforts to ensure an inclusive work environment in which diverse employees can play an active role.As of March 31, 2023, the ratio of women to men in the workforce was 34.0% and the ratio of women to men in management positions was 30.0% at the whole Sony Group.Additionally, Sony considers increasing gender diversity as an area of focus for Japan, where the ratio of women to men in management positions is low and the number of women majoring in the fields of science or engineering is limited.Sony also hires and provides workplace support for individuals with disabilities.Beyond complying with the laws, rules, and regulations of each nation and region in which it operates, Sony is devoted to creating inclusive workplaces where all employees, regardless of disability, can build careers.The Sony Group as a whole endeavors to increase the accessibility of its products and services, and undertakes initiatives related to diversity and social justice.In 2020, the Group established the 100 million USD 'Global Social Justice Fund' to provide support to organizations advocating for social justice and human rights, and promote DE&amp;I initiatives worldwide.In April 2023, Sony made changes to its organizational structure to strengthen such initiatives across the group, newly appointing the Senior Executive in charge of Lead of Group DE&amp;I and the Senior Vice President in charge of Group DE&amp;I Promotion.By further evolving Sony's DE&amp;I initiatives, Sony promotes diversity, the source of innovation, creating new value that leads to both the growth of the Sony Group and the development of society.Sony's policy requiring respect for human rights is set forth in the Sony Group Code of Conduct.Sony expects all Sony group companies to practice  responsible business conduct by respecting all human rights in compliance with the Code as well as all relevant laws and regulations.Under this policy, Sony established and implemented group policies specific to the human rights area, such as 'Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct' which sets forth the code of conduct for Sony's own manufacturing sites and suppliers, and aims to work towards a responsible supply chain, and 'Sony Group AI Ethics Guidelines,' which guide all Sony officers and employees to utilize AI and/or conduct AI-related R&amp;D in a manner that conforms with our values and emerging social norms.Sony engages in initiatives to prevent or mitigate any potential negative impact on human rights in line with the frameworks set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) issued by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.As one of our major efforts, Sony conducts human rights risk impact assessments, which serve as the starting point for human rights due diligence.After identifying potential human rights risks that are highly relevant to Sony's business activities, the assessments further identified three areas as priority areas for enhancing initiatives throughout the Sony Group: responsible supply chains; respect for diversity, equity and inclusion and responsible development; and use of technologies.As a result of the assessments, Sony promotes individual initiatives for each of these areas.For example, an overview of Sony's efforts in the area of 'Responsible Supply Chain' are as follows:- \u00b7 Implements the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct which adopts RBA Code of Conduct, industry best practice for achieving a responsible supply chain to our own electronics manufacturing sites and suppliers, then continue to respond to human rights, labor, safety or environmental issues throughout the supply chain.- \u00b7 Checks compliance status annually for our own manufacturing sites, and at the start of business and regularly thereafter with OEM/ODM, raw materials and parts suppliers depending on level of risk and size of business.- \u00b7 As a result of the above assessments, Sony requests improvements from manufacturing sites and suppliers that were determined to require corrective measures, and provides support and monitoring until the completion of improvements.As the environment continues to change rapidly and substantially worldwide, social and environmental problems are increasing in gravity.Sony believes that it is essential to contribute to the solving of such problems through the application of technology.To that end, Sony supports technological development that helps businesses grow, along with innovation that betters society and industry for the future.In 2022 Sony established its R&amp;D mission: 'Push our civilization forward and make this planet sustainable.' To help facilitate this, the company conducts research and development in businesses and fields where it can enrich people's lives, shape social infrastructure, and make significant contributions to sustainability.Sony's research and development is underway, for example, on sensing technology that measures the water content in soil, ultra-wide-area communication network technology, and predictive data analytics technology based on captured data.Sony has combined these technologies to build Sony's Earth MIMAMORI platform aiming to help predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters and contribute to solve environmental concerns.The intelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionality helps to raise efficiency and productivity in society, such as by realizing smart cities and factories.The IMX500 processes data inside the sensor itself, and is capable of extracting only necessary data.In transmitting a 4K image to the cloud, for example, it can reduce the volume of data to one-7,400th of what the average digital camera transmits, helping to reduce energy consumption and communication costs.Sony will continue to develop and offer solutions to create value for society by applying its technologies in partnership with other companies.Sensing technologyNetwork technologyPredictive data analyticsIntelligent vision sensor IMX500, which is a CMOS image sensor equipped with AI processing functionalitySmart city trial project in Rome, Italy, using the intelligent vision sensor IMX500Sony's SustainabilityBusiness OverviewEditorial PolicyAt a Glance 2022The Sony Group Code of Conduct Approach to SustainabilitySony's Purpose &amp; Values",

    "text": "Sony has pursued environmental initiatives since the 1970s, and began setting environmental principles and targets in the early 1990s.In April 2010, Sony established the 'Road to Zero,' a plan to realize a sustainable society by achieving a zero environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of its products and business activities by 2050.In May 2022, Sony made the decision to bring forward the target year of achieving a zero environmental footprint in the climate change area by ten years from 2050 to 2040.Working toward a zero environmental footprint, once every five years Sony sets concrete medium-term environmental targets for each stage of the life cycle for its products with respect to climate change, resources, chemical substances, and biodiversity.Since its establishment, Sony has sought to remain at the forefront of technological development and the discovery of new businesses, building continuously on its achievements to deliver new value for people everywhere.In these efforts, Sony recognizes the people who work at Sony to be its most important management resources.Sony has always viewed employees not as a group, but as individuals, based on the belief that they are important stakeholders in Sony's diversified, global business and are the key to its efforts to achieve sustainable growth and generate social value.Sony respects the independence of each individual and their enthusiasm for taking on challenges and cherishes a corporate culture that places the company and employees on equal terms, based on the partnership of choice between Sony and each individual employee, where each party is accountable for being responsive to the needs of the other.Sony Group has defined a shared group-wide People Philosophy of 'Special You, Diverse Sony' with the aim of maximizing the value created by its 110,000 diverse employees and in line with Sony's Purpose &amp; Values, which lead to further evolutions.The group-wide people strategy is based on this philosophy and is organized around the themes of 'Attract talented individuals,' 'Develop talented individuals,' and 'Engage talented individuals,' leading to human resource policies that reflect the characteristics of the environments and regions in which each individual business operates.Sony believes that increasing employee engagement by making the most of the individual skills, abilities, and creativity among teams of employees who are diverse in terms of race, nationality, religion, disabilities, gender, values, and work styles contributes to the sustained generation of social value and increases in corporate value.Sony is aware of the human rights impacts of its global business activities.Sony recognizes that respecting human rights throughout Sony's value chain and addressing any potential human rights risks, whether the relationship with Sony's business operation is direct or indirect, is a responsibility that a diverse range of stakeholders hold Sony accountable to.Sony has set down its fundamental human rights policy in the Sony Group Code of Conduct, which specifies that to respect human rights should be the basic stance of all Sony directors, executives, and employees.In recent years, stakeholders have grown increasingly aware of how crucial it is that companies fulfill their overall responsibilities throughout their supply chains.Sony takes these stakeholder concerns seriously and is working closely with its suppliers on initiatives in fields such as human rights, labor conditions, health and safety, and environmental protection.These initiatives cover not only Sony's own sites, but sites throughout the supply chain-from suppliers, to mineral mining operations, to production sites operated both by Sony and by contract manufacturers.Each and every Sony director, executive, and employee complies with the Sony Group Code of Conduct and conducts ethical business practices.Based on this approach, Sony focuses on supply chain management and responsible procurement of minerals and works with suppliers and subcontractors to establish a responsible supply chain that ensures compliance with the Sony Supply Chain Code of Conduct and the Sony Group Policy for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals.These efforts are undertaken in collaboration with relevant industry organizations and other stakeholders.In recent years, customers and other stakeholders have become increasingly concerned about the protection of consumer rights.Product safety, security, and accessibility are vital in this respect.True to its philosophy and policy for product quality and customer service, Sony is wholeheartedly committed to improving product and service quality from its customers' viewpoints in order to maintain and enhance satisfaction, confidence, and trust.In particular, Sony is working to ensure product safety and security while also improving usability and accessibility, in the conviction that its most important goal is to remain a highly trusted partner to all customers.Sony can only create sustainable social value based on its Purpose when the global environment is healthy and people can live in society with comfort.It is Sony's responsibility as a global company to recognize various social issues and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society via community engagement activities.Doing so helps Sony to build relationships of trust with communities.Under the slogan 'For the Next Generation,' Sony engages in various ways with communities everywhere it does business by making the most of Sony Group products, content, technologies, stakeholder partnerships, and the strengths of its employees.Alignment of our Purpose &amp; Values through ethical and responsible conduct earns trust for the Sony brand and supports Sony's value creation.With this in mind, Sony's ethics and compliance program is designed to comply with laws, manage key group-wide risks and foster an ethical corporate culture.The program is continuously improved based on both best practices and global regulatory expectations.Sony has also adopted in-depth group-wide policies, procedures and controls for key risk areas such as antitrust, anti-corruption, and privacy and personal information management.Senior management evidences its commitment to ethical business conduct by repeatedly communicating the importance of staying true to the Code and leading by example.Historically, Sony Group Corporation has consistently focused on effective group management by evolving its governance while diversifying its businesses, the regions it serves and its capital procurement methods.Sony Group Corporation therefore continuously strives to strengthen its corporate governance system based on the understanding that corporate governance is an essential basis to promote our management in order to fulfill the company's corporate social responsibility and increases corporate value over the mid- and long-term.To operate Sony effectively, Sony Group Corporation continues to approach its corporate governance through two basic precepts:- (a)   The Board of Directors (the 'Board') , a majority of which is comprised of independent Outside Directors, focuses on effective oversight of management's operation of the business and maintains a sound and transparent governance framework by utilizing the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committees; and- (b)   The Board determines Sony's fundamental management policies and other material matters and delegates to each of the Senior Executives that assume important roles for the management of Sony, including the Corporate Executive Officers, decision-making authority to conduct Sony's business operations broadly in line with their respective responsibilities, as defined with a view to promoting timely and efficient decision-making within Sony.",
