        "text": "Decarbonizing aerospace is both the challenge and opportunity of our lifetime We have long maintained that decarbonizing aerospace will take everything energy , entrepreneurship and everyone employees , customers , financiers , regulators , academics and business partners .\nFor that reason , we just convened global thought leaders and decision-makers from across these communities to review our progress to date and discuss the way forward toward achieving Sustainable Aerospace Together : Aerospace is more than an industry : We connect people around the globe and promote an understanding of different cultures , we protect through national security and humanitarian relief , we contribute to the global economy with jobs , trade , technology and commerce , and we inspire young minds to seek careers in STEM .\nCommercial aviation also generates about 2.5 % of the worlds carbon emissions and 12 % of transport emissions , so we must find ways to further decouple forecasted growth of aerospace from greenhouse gas emissions ( GHG ) and continue to do so safely and transparently .\nThe engagement was energizing and encouraging as sector leaders leaned into the issues and potential roadblocks that could slow the commercial aviation industry 's progress toward meeting its net-zero 2050 ambition . What struck me was the collective decision in tackling this issue together for the greater of the industry and humanity at large .\nIt was also a reminder that this hard to abate industry has historically solved hard challenges from inventing flight to discovering the universe .\nIts with humility and resolve that we collectively take on the challenge of more sustainable aerospace good During the event , we also launched a public version of Cascade , a web-based application that uses public aviation and energy data to visualize how various approaches might be combined to lower emissions .\nIt was rewarding to see our partners and stakeholders engage with the tool , and we ca n't wait for the global user community to further refine Cascade over time . We invite everyone to check it out at This Sustainable Aerospace Together Forum was a culmination of many activities and events that took place throughout 2022 with the same common theme together .\nWe made important progress over the past year with valued partners around the globe . We launched Cascade . At the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2022 , we announced Cascade and provided live demonstration of Version 1.0 .\nCascade was developed and explore scenarios to most effectively decarbonize commercial aviation by 2050 : fleet renewal , operational efficiency , sustainable aviation fuel ( SAF ) and new aviation technologies such as transonic truss-braced wing structures , allows stakeholders across the industry in particular customers and policymakers to make informed decisions and trade-offs about how to best reach the commercial aviation industry 's net-zero 2050 ambition : We look forward to the additional feedback from the recent public launch and will continue to invest in Cascade through collaborating with founding members of the Community to include IATA , NASA , University of Cambridge 's Whittle Laboratory and the MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment .\nNearly all industry and governmental decarbonization road maps conclude that SAF is the biggest lever we have to reduce GHG emissions from commercial aviation : Our company is focused on multiple areas to catalyze SAF scaling , including investing in airplane efficiency and compatibility , purchasing SAF for our own fuel use in our operations , engaging global regulators on smart policies , promoting robust sustainability criteria , and investing in Cascade to further industry partnerships and policy We continue to make progress on the technical journey working with our suppliers to ensure our commercial airplanes are 100 % SAF compatible by 2030 We are seeing exciting SAF innovation occurring in sustainable feedstocks and partnering on technologies including wastepower-to-liquid enablers that can make existing and future SAF pathways more sustainable over time We purchased 5.6 million gallons ( 21.2 million liters ) of blended SAF to support our commercial operations .\nThe challenge remains scaling SAF availability and lowering its cost .\nTogether , we 've made important progress this year on building the industry : Governments around the world are unlocking policy mechanisms to scale SAF , including a blending mandate and corresponding offtake requirement in Europe , and incentives such as the Blenders Tax Credit for SAF producers in the U.S These policies and incentives are beginning to attract necessary capital to scale production : Finally , the Boeing ecoDemonstrator team partnered with NASA on emissions testing to better understand SAF and contrails- We advanced the future of flight .\nWhile SAF is a necessary lever to decarbonize commercial aviation , we have a `` SAF and '' view and not a `` SAF or '' approach to achieving the commercial aviation industry 's net zero goal safety and viability of other renewable energy carriers and technologies for aircraft .\nYou 'll read about several of these developments in this report , including our Wisk joint venture 's announcement of the world 's first self-flying , all-electric four-passenger vertical takeoff and landing ( eVTOL ) air taxi .\nAs Wisk 's go-to-market aircraft , the latest generation of this aircraft represents the first-ever candidate for type of an autonomous eVTOL We also value our partnerships around the world to advance sustainable technologies , such as the new Boeing Research and Technology center in Japan with a focus on sustainability : We are also honored to be selected by NASA for the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program , which will inform future designs that could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and future efficiency gains The aforementioned Boeing ecoDemonstrator program embodies our `` together '' theme and is celebrating its in operational environments with a variety of partners , including airline customers , suppliers and regulatory this year 's effort , the ecoDemonstrator program will have evaluated more than 225 technologies with approximately one-third of those getting implemented .\nProjects include technologies that reduce fuel use , emissions and noise , enhance safety and incorporate more sustainable materials Together as an industry , we 've made modern jet travel a reality , helped defend freedom around the world , and made We now enter the era of more sustainable aerospace .\nThe foundation we are laying now will be carried forward by future generations to preserve to be on this journey together with so many capable and committed partners around the globe.Chris Raymond Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond , Chief Sustainability Officer Boeing.
