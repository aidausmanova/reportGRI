In 2022, 14 million metric tons of CO2 were eliminated from our customers' carbon trajectories, and more than 320 million cubic meters of water saved, equivalent to the annual consumption of Singapore.In terms of social responsibility and governance, the Group launched numerous initiatives: basic package of social benefits for all employees worldwide; a purchasing policy of spending 85% in the places where we operate; gender balance on the Board of Directors; and a policy to encourage employee share ownership which has made them the Group's leading shareholder in January 2022.In 2020, with the launch of our strategic plan Impact 2023, we made environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria central to the Group's operations through multifaceted performance.More than a simple reporting method and more than just a communication plan, this is a genuine tool for steering and transforming the Group.This multifaceted performance is second nature to Veolia, which defines its success by its usefulness, and views economic, social and environmental concerns as an indivisible whole.We therefore devote equal attention to all our stakeholders by setting ourselves clear performance targets in five areas: commercial, economic/financial, environmental, human resources, and social, all underpinned by robust, proactive governance.This multifaceted performance guides not only our development choices but also the way in which we run our businesses.These are just a few of many examples:\u2192 We made the responsible rather than the easy choice by investing significantly to eliminate coal from our heat networks in Central and Eastern Europe, resisting the temptation to simply divest these businesses, and we are investing in biogas capture at our landfill sites in Latin America;\u2192 We increased the proportion of our business engaged in the circular economy (\u20ac8.4 billion in 2022), especially in plastics recycling (490,000 t of plastics recycled in 2022);\u2192 In our historically rather maledominated business areas, we are now showing strong growth in female representation in our teams (25.2% in 2022 vs.18.2% in 2019) and 30% female managers;\u2192 We are pursuing an ambitious policy regarding top management compensation, with a bonus that is 50% based on quantitative criteria, with 50% relating to non-financial criteria.And we'll keep building on this momentum! But we will also continue to explain the unique features of our business models and activities, as Veolia has become a unique company in the world, the first to achieve top-tier status simultaneously in water, waste and energy.Our strength'Everywhere Veolia operates, our stakeholders must see a 'before' and an 'after' thanks to our solutions, our standards of excellence, and our multifaceted performance approach.'is derived from the combination of our business areas, which allows us to offer our customers groundbreaking solutions for ecological transformation.Committed to working tirelessly to support our customers in their ecological transformation, we are also acting to reduce our own environmental footprint:- by intensifying our efforts towards Net Zero Carbon by 2050, while explaining how some of the activities that inflate our carbon figures - converting assets on behalf of our customers, eliminating hazardous waste, etc.- are actually good news for the planet,- by advocating for recognition of the emissions we reduce, avoid or eliminate for our customers,- by restating that our role is to provide drinking water for people in regions often subject to water stress; that we lead the way in identifying and anticipating risks to our own and our customers' infrastructure; and above all, that we are there to provide solutions (efficient networks, wastewater reuse, etc.) to help improve their resilience.When it comes to assessing companies' ESG performance, the co-benefits of their activities for their own value chains and those of their customers are not given sufficient recognition.For Veolia, these co-benefits come in the form of emissions avoided, resources untapped, and water not extracted.The purpose of this document is to highlight Veolia's ESG achievements since 2020.Since our strategic plan launched in 2020, we have constantly pursued our ESG targets to ensure the consistency and success of our multifaceted performance.And we will introduce our strategic plan for 2024-2027 at the beginning of next year with renewed determination.A simple message to end on: everywhere Veolia operates, our stakeholders must see a 'before' and an 'after' thanks to our solutions, our standards of excellence, and our multifaceted performance approach, which combines ESG and corporate strategy.VEOLIAWITH NEARLY 220,000 EMPLOYEES working in water, waste, and energy on five continents, the Group designs and provides solutions to decarbonize, save and regenerate resources and depollute that are useful and practical for local authorities, industry, and the commercial sector.GROUP",

    "text": "The worldwide explosion in consumption of natural resources is causing depletion of, and pressure on, strategic supplies for the digital and energy transitions.In addition, the intensive use of these resources is having major environmental impacts, including excessive water use, harm to biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions.The very essence of Veolia's business is to preserve natural resources.That is why the Group is offering its customers a range of solutions to achieve exactly that:- \u2192 Production of 'secondary raw materials' from waste (recycled plastics, rare metals from electronic waste, reclaimed solvents, compost, etc.);- \u2192 Production of renewable and recovered energy from waste and wastewater, and recovery of waste energy;- \u2192 Reuse of treated wastewater;- \u2192 Energy efficiency in buildings and industrial facilities;- \u2192 Synergies from multi-client sites (local industrial ecology, biomass heat networks).Veolia is also contributing to the mobilization of all public and private stakeholders to accelerate the implementation of circular economy solutions, for example, the debate around the anti-waste and circular economy law in France, and the European Union Green Deal and circular economy action plan.In particular, Veolia's proven expertise in the sustainable management of water resources enables it to make ambitious commitments on behalf of its municipal and industrial customers in relation to preventing water risks and meeting public expectations.This is based on a range of technical, business and behavioral solutions across the entire value chain.For example:- \u2192 General access to public water and sanitation services;- \u2192 Treatment of industrial wastewater and leachates, collection and treatment of hazardous liquid waste, sludge recovery, and soil decontamination;- \u2192 Reusing treated wastewater to preserve resources and safeguard access to water in troubled locations;- \u2192 Collection, management and recovery of solid waste (plastics, etc.) to keep it from entering the environment;- \u2192 Optimizing operational efficiency for heat networks, industrial services, and building management.Worldwide, only 56% of domestic wastewater is safely treated.(1)  Reliable sanitation services are key to public health, but are lacking for 4.2 billion people, more than half the world's population.(2) UNICEF and the WHO estimate that 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged untreated into the environment.(3)  Soil quality and the chemical and ecological status of watercourses continue to deteriorate.Veolia's activities help to preserve natural environments and reduce a number of pressures on biodiversity (climate change, pollution, and overuse of natural resources including water).Sanitation activities ensure that high-quality water is discharged into the natural environment, helping maintain watercourses (flow-rate support and the creation of good ecological conditions) and protecting water resources against pollution.The development of centralized urban heat networks, constantly monitored and subject to strict regulation, and the selection of certified biomass streams to power them, also reduce environmental impacts compared with more polluting systems.Collecting and treating waste limits the spread of urban and industrial pollution into soils, bodies of water and the atmosphere.Veolia's activities prevent and repair the harm caused by toxic pollution, treating and recovering toxic waste to protect health and the environment, activities that require a high level of expertise.Industrial activities taking place on Group-operated sites can have direct or indirect negative local environmental impacts, though these are minuscule compared with the reduction in its customers' impacts.These include the consumption of natural resources through site activities, the residual pollution contained in operational discharges, the sites' greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential impact of their footprint on habitats.Control of these risks, which are classed as operational risks, is an integral part of the Group's environmental policy.Each of Veolia's activities is dependent on ecosystem services:\u2192 Drinking water production correlates directly with correct functioning of the large water cycle and the capacity of natural environments to purify themselves;\u2192 Sanitation activities depend on ecological factors: microbial activity and the capacity of aquatic environments to assimilate residual loads are critical to wastewater purification;- \u2192 For energy, biomass activity requires a sustainable supply of fuelwood or plant waste.",
