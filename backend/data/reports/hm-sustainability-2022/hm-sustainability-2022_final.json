development, we developed an internal tool to complement Circulator.- We are working with industry peers including -ASOS, BESTSELLER and Zalando in the Circular Design Consortium.Initial priorities were to align approaches and agree terminology.Now we will expand the scope of work to drive further impact and scale.Our work with external reviewers, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Circular.Fashion, supports the quality of our circular design work.- We are working to increase our pattern -efficiency by supporting product teams to share their methods and improve practices.To encourage further waste reduction, we developed an internal report to enable the whole organisation to track our progress on fabric consumption and efficiency at Group, brand and department levels.- To understand the longevity of our products -and prepare for forthcoming EU initiatives, we ran a durability project, testing a significant share of our core materials and products.This includes colour fastness and strength tests, and investigating the longevity of products after numerous washes, beyond our minimum requirements.These findings will inform the development of our durability strategy ahead.- H&amp;M developed a quality scorecard for -selected garment groups in its menswear collection.The scorecard sets requirements on aspects such as number of washes a garment can withstand and other quality aspects.The accompanying product quality dashboard uses a range of data sources to determine factors impacting quality, and is supported by supplier training to share H&amp;M's ambitions and expectations.- Our brands launched collections designed to -be more circular:- - H&amp;M's Let's Make Better Denim collection and Monki's first denim collection designed for circularity were released, both following EMF's Jeans Redesign guidelines.Weekday is scaling use of the guidelines across its assortment,- We joined the TMC advisory board and are -exploring how we can best implement the TMC commitment.So far, we have contributed with fabric-level testing, using the test method developed by TMC.- To help shape draft legislation, we developed -a position paper on microfibres, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach that is both science-based and collaborative.The paper stresses the need for legislation to cover all relevant stages of the product life cycle, support and recognise ongoing industry research, and take a step-by-step risk-based approach based on common methodology.We also used the position paper to advocate for a full impact assessment of potential policy measures to ensure effective regulation, and to highlight the importance of addressing the issue in a collaborative and harmonised manner worldwide.SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT- We have three research projects under way -with the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA).These are focused on understanding the levels of fibre fragmentation for different materials during production, cleaning microfibres from wastewater using soundwaves, and researching the use of bacteria to degrade microfibres in effluent treatment plants.- We partnered with Forum for the Future (FFTF) -to support its Tackling Microfibres at Source research project.We also worked with FFTF to deliver capacity-building workshops with our suppliers - primarily fabric manufacturers - exploring challenges and solutions for fibre fragmentation.- ARKET and H&amp;M continue to promote and sell -laundry bags to help customers reduce microfibre shedding during laundry.- We are working with third-party consultants to -set a methodology for collection of environmental impact data, set a baseline and verify data for conventional textile production technologies.This work is essential to enable comparison and measurement of progress, since there are currently no industrywide benchmarks or baselines.Better data will enable us to compare and identify processes with lower negative impacts in our five focus areas and share our knowledge with the industry.- We conducted a project to identify chemicals -substitutions with lower environmental impacts and other opportunities for process improvements.- Our participation in a member expert team -for textile wet processes with the SustainableApparel Coalition Higg Materials Sustainability Index (SAC Higg MSI) supports our long-term objective to have fully aligned industry tools for measuring the impact of production processes.- We continue to invest in new washing and -dyeing innovations, supporting them to scale up, including:- - H&amp;M CO:LAB continued to invest in Colorifix, a biotech company that uses microbiology to produce and fix dye on textiles.The first large Colorifix bioreactor was installed in Portugal at the end of 2022.A number of our brands and assortments are ready to develop and place orders.- - Dyeing and finishing company Alchemie, also receiving continued H&amp;M CO:LAB investment, set up pilots in Taiwan and Turkey to showcase its process to our suppliers.The first bulk machine for polyester will be installed in the Taiwan Region at the end of the year.- - DigitalDyeing\u00ae innovator Imogo has been involved in several successful trials and is working with selected suppliers within our supply chain.\u00a0One of our suppliers in Bangladesh has bought a machine that will be ready early in 2023.- - H&amp;M continued developing and scaling projects with Alchemie, Colorifix and Imogo.The brand developed new partnerships with Algaeing, which produces 100% biodegradable algae-based dyes and threads, and Recycrom, which has developed a multi-purpose dye made from textile waste fibres.- Our 2022 priority was to complete the shift -from single use plastic to reusable plastic or alternative materials - read more below.We achieved an absolute reduction in plastic packaging of 44% of plastic compared to our baseline year 2018.Of the remaining plastic weuse, 76% is recycled (55% post-consumer and 21% pre-consumer).We have therefore reached our plastic targets ahead of time, so will revise our circular packaging strategy - read more on page\u00a057.- 92% of waste handled in H&amp;M Group -distribution centres was recycled or reused (92% in 2021).- We partnered with Virginia Tech University -to explore how to measure the impact of online packaging through a product Life Cycle Assessment.- We have an ongoing dialogue with Canopy -about how to switch our dependencies on virgin wood fibres to more recycled materials and next generation fibres, and are continuing to explore this.- We are strengthening our IT solutions to -improve packaging decisions in the product development stage as well as supporting our suppliers to reduce the material consumption for packaging.Where this is impemented, we have seen good progress on both resourse reduction and cost savings.- Polybags.-We are taking steps to reduce, replace or remove unnecessary polybags throughout our supply chain.We shipped the first global collection using paper instead of single use plastic polybags for H&amp;M Baby and H&amp;M Men.We are also switching from virgin plastic to post-consumer recycled plastic for master polybags used in transportation.We will continueto increase the share of post-consumer recycled plastic in our garment polybags.- Hangers.-In line with our Chemical Roadmap we aim to eliminate or replace all hangers made of polystyrene by the end of 2023.We are moving away from single use hangers and, in 2022, 26% of all our hangers were reused.We accelerated the industry's systemic shift to a circular model by collaborating with suppliers and collectors, and implementing the Return to Source model in more markets.- Transit (e-commerce and transport) -packaging .The major share of the packaging we use going forward will be transit packaging.For online packaging, we have worked to optimise the size and weight of the FSC-certified paper bag that replaced single-use plastic bags for all our brands and markets.For transport packaging, we're carrying out ongoing research and development to increase post-consumer recycled material and product durability.Our reverse supply chains work will help to secure end-to-end responsibility of these packaging types, ensuring packaging is reusable or recyclable.- Shopping bags in stores.-We saw an immediate 40% reduction in usage of in-store shopping bags following the introduction of bag charges.2- Materials.-We're working to improve the chain of custody for FSC-certified materials to have better control of the traceability process.- 2) Reduced consumption of paper bags in store (-40% compared to 2019) is calculated for the countries (Colombia, Mexico, Spain and New Zealand) that started charging for bags in 2022.- We contributed SEK 114.2 million 1  to community -investment initiatives, reaching 745,517 beneficiaries.- Our community engagement programme -My Store expanded, engaging customers and colleagues on local sustainability issues.Now all countries in the Central Europe region within the H&amp;M brand are participating, in addition to Spain and India, with 80% of the initiatives focusing on I&amp;D in underprivileged groups.207 stores currently participate.- Following the start of the war in Ukraine, H&amp;M -Group split a EUR 1.5 million donation equally to our long-standing partners UNICEF and UNHCR.We also donated 150,836 garments to UNHCR.Our customers donated SEK 10,972,927 in stores and online, in collaboration with our payment service provider ADYEN.Due to large demand in other regions of the world, we also donated 190,513 pieces of clothing to UNHCR for people in South Sudan.- COS launched a programme that pays up

underlined by our 2030 goal, which combine targets for company growth and profit with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.To reach our ambitious climate goals of halving the group's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040, we invest in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our whole value chain.During the year, our climate goals were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative and we established the Green Fashion Initiative to support our suppliers in replacing fossil fuels.We also signed long-term virtual power purchase agreements in the UK, Sweden and Spain to cover electricity consumption in our operations in a majority of European markets.This will not only help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also secure our energy prices.Investments in sustainability provide the group with long-term business opportunities.By building strategic partnerships with key stakeholders and growing in various innovative ways such as circular business models, we can grow our business in a way that decouples our financial growth and profitability from the use of finite natural resources.A good example of this is majority-owned, fast-growing Sellpy, which is already one of the biggest players in secondhand fashion in Europe.Our investment arm CO:LAB is a way for us to explore new business models, and in addition to Sellpy we have invested in startups such as Smartex, Renewcell and Colorifix, to mention just a few.Our investments have in a short time created significant value, for example by improving the customer experience and enabling scaling and commercialisation of recycled and more sustainably sourced materials.We will continue to make investments in new business models, materials and technologies that have the potential to drive radical shifts in how we make and remake our products, and how our customers can experience fashion.Alongside these efforts, we will keep working for increased levels of transparency to empower customers to make more informed decisions about the products they buy.Looking ahead, our main focus is on continuing to invest in and develop our customer offering and shopping experience for our unique brands, so that we keep meeting and exceeding our customers' needs and expectations.Despite the turbulent world around us, H&amp;M Group stands strong with a wide customer base, a robust financial position, healthy cash flow and a well-balanced inventory.This is all thanks to the commitment from colleagues all around the world, who continue to build our company, stand

further and faster, we are increasing efforts to decarbonise our value chain - including investing in projects to support our suppliers in reducing their own emissions.Developing the processes and infrastructure to scale circular options for our customers is an important lever to reach our climate goals.This year, our use of recycled materials accelerated, reaching 23% (up from 18%) and contributing to a total of 84% recycled or other more sustainably sourced materials in our collections.H&amp;M also integrated an assortment from Sellpy into its website, as part of our effort to

and technologies to track our progress and communicate openly with our customers.Trying new things involves greater risk, but is also essential to finding opportunities for improvement.- Our industry still has a long way to go to meet -expectations for information and data about products and their impacts.Industry alignment and collaboration are key to making progress, and we will continue to learn and contribute.We welcome harmonised methodologies for product claims in the EU, such as PEF.- We are continuously working to improve our -material integrity routines.In preparation for forthcoming regulations and legislation around sustainability claims we need to continue investing in competence development and improving internal data flows to ensure our product claims are as transparent and accurate as possible.- Robust, automated data systems are required -to replace our current approach, where technical and human errors are possible.Securing a seamless flow of data through our systems remains a major challenge and a priority.- It's challenging to find on-product transparency -solutions that are scalable for supply chainsacross the whole industry.Starting small and scaling up gradually may be a better way forward.- Calculating accurate GHG emissions data is -complex.We're continually working on improving data quality and calculation methods.- From working on our green investments we've -learned that in addition to security of business and financial support, supplier factories benefit from increased knowledge about decarbonisation and inspiration to implement GHG emissions reduction strategies.Supporting suppliers' switch from gas and coal to electrical power will be key to lowering emissions long term, partly due to the lack of renewable substitutes for traditional fossil fuels in many regions.3) Permanent carbon dioxide removals for use under the net-zero standard are currently being defined by the SBTi, but will likely mean those that have a durability of &gt;1000 years.- Finding the best local setup for intervention -projects is complex and requires suitable farmers and crops, and the right legislative environment to enable lasting positive social and environmentalSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENTimpact.For future projects more time will be allocated for these steps.- Traceability is key for us to fully understand our -impact on the ground.Secondary data will only take us so far, but sourcing from trustable geographical locations is key for our impact assessment and future science-based targets.This emphasises the need to continue extending our traceability work and to partner with stakeholders that can help us achieve traceability down to farm level.- Development of global goals, alongside -clear expectations from governments to define common ambitions and progress, will enable us to make progress more quickly with our partners when the agenda, scope and timeline are shared.- We are exploring synergies between chemicals -management and other impact areas such as water, energy, raw materials and biodiversity.This year we began investigating opportunities to reduce chemical use by mapping best practices, such as process chemicals recovery.We learnt that there is a lack of reliable baseline data for the quantity of chemicals in our value chain.- There is work to be done in our industry to -make production processes more resource efficient in terms of chemical use.We continued our work to investigate ways to optimise production processes in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.- There are challenges with securing early--stage data that enables Circulator's predictive assessment, and we are exploring how to update our way of working to address this.- Integrating circular design at scale is a long -process that requires a mindset shift to design for product purpose and consider the entire product journey when developing products.It entails cross-functional collaboration from many different stakeholder groups.Integration also requires a strong understanding of the value of circular design for transitioning to a more circular business and reaching our goals on climate and nature.- To fully integrate circular design principles, we -need to develop new KPIs and metrics not wholly based on financial performance.- A key challenge is the current lack of industry -definitions on circular design.Industrywide collaboration and knowledge exchange is crucial to develop a shared understanding of circular design principles, together with policymakers.- Creating garments from mono rather than -blended materials increases their recyclability but presents some challenges.For example, cellulosic threads have limited strength and longer production times.We are learning about and adapting to these challenges with continuous innovation and collaboration with sorters, recyclers and suppliers.- There is a need for better and more accurate -environmental impact data in the industry.We have reached out to our material suppliers to encourage them to share their data directly with initiatives such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's Materials Sustainability Index.- Traceability is essential to be able to measure -real impact, steer and track sourcing, and mitigate risks - read more about our progress on traceability.- Systemic shifts at industry level are key -to scaling recycled materials.Innovation in recycled fibres has expanded rapidly across all fibre groups, but commercial scale-up remains slow due to technology and financing gaps, and sometimes due to legislative barriers to resource recirculation.There is also a clear need to connect sort and collect systems with the emerging capacity for recycling.- Our work with regenerative agriculture projects -shows the potential for impact, but significant investment is needed develop regenerative practices at scale.- Many standard holders and certification -bodies are updating or developing approaches to strengthen human rights due diligence at the raw material level, to align with international guidelines and evolving regulation.This will require new ways of working and increased collaboration across the sector.- We're learning from our work to secure -reverse supply chains for resource recirculation, including the need to engage even more closely on emerging EU legislation to ensure policy supports effective processes and infrastructure.There is complexity around waste regulations and infrastructure, and a need for more EU-harmonised waste regulations.- We need to scale services that enable reuse -of products before they end up at the collecting bin and sorting facility.We need to keep products closer to the user for longer and at their highest value.- There is still a gap in scalable systems and -technologies for sorting and recycling, especially for blended textiles.This makes the progress for us and the industry slower than we would have wished for.- Putting our Responsible Waste Management -Guidelines for production waste into practice has shown a clear need for more localised recycling infrastructure.Increased investment and innovation in waste separation and recycling technology are required to achieve this, alongsidewidespread recognition of the value of resources left over from production.- We're seeing increasing need to accelerate -activities that enable textile-to-textile circulation around the globe and research alternatives to current textile options.This will require us to continue making investments in recycling technology, focusing on scaling up of pre- and post-consumer recycled materials and developing our reverse supply chains.- Our collaboration with suppliers to maximise -hanger reuse and recycling demonstrates how effective and impactful business-to-business partnerships can be in the shift to a more circular economy.- Our work with Virginia Tech showed the -complexity of measuring the environmental impact of online packaging.To evaluate the entire environmental footprint effectively, a Life Cycle Assessment needs to be complemented by methods to measure aspects such as material circulation and land use.- There can be challenges and trade-offs in -shifting from plastic to recycled or sustainably sourced paper packaging.Paper packaging might require higher volume and weight than plastic because thicker paper is needed for equivalent protection.Recycled paper is less durable than virgin paper so we will continue to work on finding strong recycled paper alternatives.- Polybags have an important function, -protecting products in distribution centres and in transit.Our challenge is to find and secure more sustainable alternatives - such as durablerecycled paper packaging - to serve the same purpose.We have started removing polybags from socks and aim to do so for other products once we find viable solutions.- We learned a lot from our collaboration with -Biomason, including the complexity in replacing a traditional floor tile with an alternative material that has the quality we require.Therefore, we have agreed to not continue with the partnership in its existing format.We are committed to finding a more sustainable floor product and will continue- to follow developments at Biomason as well as seeking out other innovative solutions.- Existing legislations do not support a circular -way of working so reuse of interiors between stores and markets can be challenging, particularly when it comes to asset value transfer.- Optimising office space and reusing or selling -interior products, rather than sending them for recycling, has not only saved resources and avoided GHG emissions, but is also a profitable business case.- To respond quickly and efficiently to changing -contexts around the world, and to meet our legal and operational requirements, we need to continue to align our internal processes, facilitate information flows and strengthen the global, connected approach to our business.- We will further harmonise our people -processes to increase efficiency across brands, functions and regions.This shared approach will enable further development of, for example, our work on talent acquisition as well as rewards, including compensation, benefits, and pensions.- To enable collaboration and communication -across H&amp;M Group, we continue to roll out the foundation for our new digital communication and collaboration platform, One Experience.By streamlining our communication channels, all colleagues in all parts of the business can stay informed and connected.- We will continue to develop and implement the -H&amp;M Group Minimum Employment Standards globally in all our operations.- Employee engagement remains a priority and -we are developing a strategy to improve the coordination of various internal initiatives across H&amp;M Group.- We have a clear ambition for inclusion and -diversity across the H&amp;M Group.Our current challenge lies in the need for continuous implementation and the provision of support to markets and functions with different levels of maturity and expertise.- In an increasingly polarised world, we see -varying acceptance of our inclusion and diversity values.As some countries broaden rights andsocietal diversity, others implement restrictive laws and limit pluralism.In some markets, legal constraints can reduce our ability to roll out trainings and ensure that all can benefit from our commitment to I&amp;D.We are constantly exploring how we can best contribute to public dialogue on these issues and help influence policies and attitudes in accordance with our values.- Hybrid and digital working during the pandemic -opened up the potential for more diversity, while returning to the office strengthens our culture and relationships.We are keen to continue leveraging both ways of working to remove practical barriers and strengthen internal diversity.- Developing industry tools and standards -based on impacts rather than compliance checks will require work to fill gaps in data and increase visibility of issues on the ground.We are committed to working with our suppliers to improve the quality and reliability of the data we collect.We do, however, face some challenges such as accuracy of third-party data verifications, and we continue to give constant feedback to verification oversight organisations to address discrepancies, which should help us improve data quality for industry tools.Further improvements are likely to involve expanding the channels through which we gather data and compliance information, including working more with external auditors and using complementary tools such as grievance mechanisms."}, {"section_idx":

for our customers based on our learnings.In the longer term, this will include increasing access to second-hand clothing by integrating it further into our customer journey.- We will revise our groupwide circular packaging -strategy, set in 2018, as the landscape we are operating in has changed since then.We are shifting more towards selling online and selling interior products through H&amp;M Home, which requires a different type of protection to garment circular packaging.We are also shifting from using single-use plastic to paper packaging, to support higher rates of recycling from our customers.We will update our strategy and revise our overall packaging reduction goals, our approach to plastics use and our recycled packaging targets.- We will continue to explore reverse
