    "title": "Some words &amp; phrases used in this report",
    "text": "Throughout this report we use certain words and phrases to describe our approach to addressing specific social and environmental issues.Here, we explain what we mean by these terms.- Circular supply chains: -Building scalable systems that circulate products and materials for repair, reuse and recycling and use lower-impact production processes - such as dyeing, printing and finishing.Circular and circularity are terms we use throughout this report in different contexts.We use them as high-level terms to describe activities aligned with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's (EMF) definition of circular economy, which focuses on three principles: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature.More specifically, we support and aspire to the EMF vision for a circular fashion industry, where products are designed to be used more, made to be made again, and made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs.Where we reference our circular ecosystem , we are referring to putting all these principles into practice through the way we operate our business and create our products, including:- Circular products: -Creating products that are made to last from safe, recycled, regenerative or other more sustainably sourced materials that can circulate multiple times.- Circular customer journeys -: Providing convenient ways to engage in circular fashion where products are used more before being repaired, reused and recycled.Customer-facing circular business models is an additional term we use to describe circular customer journeys.Circular business models can be in place throughout the entire ecosystem.When we talk about care, repair and reuse models, we frame them as customer-facing circular business models.Fair compensation in our production supply chain refers to a wage that - in a regular work week, without overtime - is enough to meet the basic needs of employees and their families and provide some discretionary income.As a minimum, the wage should meet legal levels or applicable collective bargaining agreement levels - whichever is higher.Our vision to lead the change means innovating, incubating and investing in scaling new materials, technologies and business models with the potential to decouple our business growth from resource use.It means trying to do things differently, daring to take the first step.It means sharing more data and working to improve the accuracy and comparability of industrywide disclosure.And finally, it means collaborating with others to change the way the industry works and create the legislative environment and infrastructure required for the fashion sector of the future.",

data about products and their impacts.Industry alignment and collaboration are key to making progress, and we will continue to learn and contribute.We welcome harmonised methodologies for product claims in the EU, such as PEF.- We are continuously working to improve our -material integrity routines.In preparation for forthcoming regulations and legislation around sustainability claims we need to continue investing in competence development and improving internal data flows to ensure our product claims are as transparent and accurate as possible.- Robust, automated data systems are required -to replace our current approach, where technical and human errors are possible.Securing a seamless flow of data through our systems remains a major challenge and a priority.- It's challenging to find on-product transparency -solutions that are scalable for supply chainsacross the whole industry.Starting small and scaling up gradually may be a better way forward.- Calculating accurate GHG emissions data is -complex.We're continually working on improving data quality and calculation methods.- From working on our green investments we've -learned that in addition to security of business and financial support, supplier factories benefit from increased knowledge about decarbonisation and inspiration to implement GHG emissions reduction strategies.Supporting suppliers' switch from gas and coal to electrical power will be key to lowering emissions long term, partly due to the lack of renewable substitutes for traditional fossil fuels in many regions.3) Permanent carbon dioxide removals for use under the net-zero standard are currently being defined by the SBTi, but will likely mean those that have a durability of &gt;1000 years.- Finding the best local setup for intervention -projects is complex and requires suitable farmers and crops, and the right legislative environment to enable lasting positive social and environmentalSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENTimpact.For future projects more time will be allocated for these steps.- Traceability is key for us to fully understand our -impact on the ground.Secondary data will only take us so far, but sourcing from trustable geographical locations is key for our impact assessment and future science-based targets.This emphasises the need to continue extending our traceability work and to partner with stakeholders that can help us achieve traceability down to farm level.- Development of global goals, alongside -clear expectations from governments to define common ambitions and progress, will enable us to make progress more quickly with our partners when the agenda, scope and timeline are shared.- We are exploring synergies between chemicals -management and other impact areas such as water, energy, raw materials and biodiversity.This year we began investigating opportunities to reduce chemical use by mapping best practices, such as process chemicals recovery.We learnt that there is a lack of reliable baseline data for the quantity of chemicals in our value chain.- There is work to be done in our industry to -make production processes more resource efficient in terms of chemical use.We continued our work to investigate ways to optimise production processes in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.- There are challenges with securing early--stage data that enables Circulator's predictive assessment, and we are exploring how to update our way of working to address this.- Integrating circular design at scale is a long -process that requires a mindset shift to design for product purpose and consider the entire product journey when developing products.It entails cross-functional collaboration from many different stakeholder groups.Integration also requires a strong understanding of the value of circular design for transitioning to a more circular business and reaching our goals on climate and nature.- To fully integrate circular design principles, we -need to develop new KPIs and metrics not wholly based on financial performance.- A key challenge is the current lack of industry -definitions on circular design.Industrywide collaboration and knowledge exchange is crucial to develop a shared understanding of circular design principles, together with policymakers.- Creating garments from mono rather than -blended materials increases their recyclability but presents some challenges.For example, cellulosic threads have limited strength and longer production times.We are learning about and adapting to these challenges with continuous innovation and collaboration with sorters, recyclers and suppliers.- There is a need for better and more accurate -environmental impact data in the industry.We have reached out to our material suppliers to encourage them to share their data directly with initiatives such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition's Materials Sustainability Index.- Traceability is essential to be able to measure -real impact, steer and track sourcing, and mitigate risks - read more about our progress on traceability.- Systemic shifts at industry level are key -to scaling recycled materials.Innovation in recycled fibres has expanded rapidly across all fibre groups, but commercial scale-up remains slow due to technology and financing gaps, and sometimes due to legislative barriers to resource recirculation.There is also a clear need to connect sort and collect systems with the emerging capacity for recycling.- Our work with regenerative agriculture projects -shows the potential for impact, but significant investment is needed develop regenerative practices at scale.- Many standard holders and certification -bodies are updating or developing approaches to strengthen human rights due diligence at the raw material level, to align with international guidelines and evolving regulation.This will require new ways of working and increased collaboration across the sector.- We're learning from our work to secure -reverse supply chains for resource recirculation, including the need to engage even more closely on emerging EU legislation to ensure policy supports effective processes and infrastructure.There is complexity around waste regulations and infrastructure, and a need for more EU-harmonised waste regulations.- We need to scale services that enable reuse -of products before they end up at the collecting bin and sorting facility.We need to keep products closer to the user for longer and at their highest value.- There is still a gap in scalable systems and -technologies for sorting and recycling, especially for blended textiles.This makes the progress for us and the industry slower than we would have wished for.- Putting our Responsible Waste Management -Guidelines for production waste into practice has shown a clear need for more localised recycling infrastructure.Increased investment and innovation in waste separation and recycling technology are required to achieve this, alongsidewidespread recognition of the value of resources left over from production.- We're seeing increasing need to accelerate -activities that enable textile-to-textile circulation around the globe and research alternatives to current textile options.This will require us to continue making investments in recycling technology, focusing on scaling up of pre- and post-consumer recycled materials and developing our reverse supply chains.- Our collaboration with suppliers to maximise -hanger reuse and recycling demonstrates how effective and impactful business-to-business partnerships can be in the shift to a more circular economy.- Our work with Virginia Tech showed the -complexity of measuring the environmental impact of online packaging.To evaluate the entire environmental footprint effectively, a Life Cycle Assessment needs to be complemented by methods to measure aspects such as material circulation and land use.- There can be challenges and trade-offs in -shifting from plastic to recycled or sustainably sourced paper packaging.Paper packaging might require higher volume and weight than plastic because thicker paper is needed for equivalent protection.Recycled paper is less durable than virgin paper so we will continue to work on finding strong recycled paper alternatives.- Polybags have an important function, -protecting products in distribution centres and in transit.Our challenge is to find and secure more sustainable alternatives - such as durablerecycled paper packaging - to serve the same purpose.We have started removing polybags from socks and aim to do so for other products once we find viable solutions.- We learned a lot from our collaboration with -Biomason, including the complexity in replacing a traditional floor tile with an alternative material that has the quality we require.Therefore, we have agreed to not continue with the partnership in its existing format.We are committed to finding a more sustainable floor product and will continue- to follow developments at Biomason as well as seeking out other innovative solutions.- Existing legislations do not support a circular -way of working so reuse of interiors between stores and markets can be challenging, particularly when it comes to asset value transfer.- Optimising office space and reusing or selling -interior products, rather than sending them for recycling, has not only saved resources and avoided GHG emissions, but is also a profitable business case.- To respond quickly and efficiently to changing -contexts around the world, and to meet our legal and operational requirements, we need to continue to align our internal processes, facilitate information flows and strengthen the global, connected approach to our business.- We will further harmonise our people

accordance with our values.- Hybrid and digital working during the pandemic -opened up the potential for more diversity, while returning to the office strengthens our culture and relationships.We are keen to continue leveraging both ways of working to remove practical barriers and strengthen internal diversity.- Developing industry tools and standards -based on impacts rather than compliance checks will require work to fill gaps in data and increase visibility of issues on the ground.We are committed to working with our suppliers to improve the quality and reliability of the data we collect.We do, however, face some challenges such as accuracy of third-party data verifications, and we continue to give constant feedback to verification oversight organisations to address discrepancies, which should help us improve data quality for industry tools.Further improvements are likely to involve expanding the channels through which we gather data and compliance information, including working more with external auditors and using complementary tools such as grievance mechanisms.",

while most reported CBAs are legitimate, they can be improved with supplemental gender-sensitive programmes and grievance mechanisms.These recommendations were shared with factory leaders and trade unions, who will lead on their implementation.Assessments were conducted across seven factories in Bangladesh, Turkey and India.We will include additional countries next year.- We began the process of

tier 1 supplier factories, and 95% of factories have grievance mechanisms created through social dialogue between unions or worker representative structures and management.In 75% of factories, management reported reviewing grievances submitted and doing root cause analysis of issues raised - ensuring the mechanism is a source of continual learning.2- As signatories to the ACT agreement, we

expand CBAs:- - In Cambodia, the Textile, Apparel, Footwear and Travel Association in Cambodia (TAFTAC) - formerly GMAC - and the trade union IndustriALL have started negotiations on a CBA with

year, our anonymous supplier survey (run internally by H&amp;M Group) showed that 89.3% of suppliers regard H&amp;M Group as a fair business partner.- We took action to bolster social dialogue in our -supply chain:- - We reviewed case handling routines and minimum requirement routines - read more in Supply Chain Management.Working with H&amp;M Group NMC members, we reiterated expectations and revised case handling procedures, including documentation and follow-through.All relevant data, such as number of cases and case resolutions, informs our risk management decisions and is included in quarterly reporting mechanisms.- - Seven colleagues participated in negotiation and mediation courses run by ILO and we have piloted an internal training programme on negotiation that is due to be rolled out more widely.- - 66 colleagues participated in training to improve case handling processes and experience.- In response to last year's ACT-facilitated -self-assessment on purchasing practices, we implemented the first of five purchasing practices trainings for buying and planning functions across our brands.498 colleagues in relevant roles 1 completed training module 1, which covers H&amp;M Group's role and commitments as a member of ACT as well as our responsibilities in improving working conditions across our supply chain.Four subsequent modules are being prepared for rollout, with more focus on supplier relations - for example costing and planning, and payment terms.- We improved our approach to exiting supplier -relationships, following guidance in the ACT Responsible Exit Policy to minimise a termination's negative impact.This policy provides guidance on recommended steps, such as conducting a worker impact assessment, creating an exit plan in close dialogue with the supplier, and informing all stakeholders of plans, particularly trade unions or other labour organisations.We monitor and communicate developments and impact throughout the whole process, which can take up to 18 months.- We updated our supplier Sustainability Index -with a new wage KPI, directly linking supplier performance on worker wages to future business opportunities with us.- 1) Business-, brand- and product-developers, controllers, buyers, merchandising teams, capacity teams, business governance teams and our sustainability team.- The Stockholm School of Economics and -Ernst &amp; Young completed two separate studies on wage formation in India, commissioned by H&amp;M Group.The studies found the local legislative and business environment was not conducive to driving minimum wage increases, and recommended H&amp;M Group work with stakeholders to explore new platforms for collaboration and different pathways to facilitate wage improvements.- As part of our ongoing effort to increase -transparency, we added two countries - Pakistan and Vietnam - to our detailed wage data reporting and continue to gather and report yearon-year wage and worker representation data in this report and on our website.- We worked with wages expert Professor -Raymond Robertson to update and improve our supplier wage survey 2  and further understand the skill and compensation levels of all workers.We expanded the scope of the survey to include suppliers in Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia and Europe, covering more than 1,300 production units.Initial findings indicate a statistically significant pay gap between men and women in most of our production countries.This seems to be driven primarily by the skill gap between genders, as men tend to be more skilled and hence benefit from higher wages.The findings from this research will inform our upcoming strategy to address our supply chain gender pay gap.2) This survey is conducted in addition to our regular quarterly wage assessment.- The Bangladesh government launched a pilot -to ensure workers in the garment sector and their families receive income in the case of permanent disability or death linked to work accidents or diseases.We collaborated with ILO and GIZ on creation of the employment injury scheme and are one of seven brands that have committed to financing it for up to five
