possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain.In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent.Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) (marketbased and management-defined criteria for Scope 3 Category 11).Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO2e.More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.We saw a 0.5 percent increase in our Scope 3 emissions this year based on investments in real-time device telemetry-based measurement, improvements in our operations and supply chain, and purchases of renewable energy.As the world transitions to a lower-carbon, clean energy economy, we're using our purchasing and investing power to help advance innovation and the development of new solutions-helping us meet our own commitments while catalyzing the creation of broader market supply for others.We fund purchases of renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal through our internal carbon fee, which we established in 2012.The fee is designed to accelerate carbon reduction and allocate funding to projects that jumpstart and scale decarbonization technologies.In FY22, we redesigned and increased our carbon fee to accelerate Scope 3 emissions reduction, tying the fee to the costs abatement for different sources-electricity, fuel, and other emissions.We will continue to evaluate the carbon fee design to align our business operations and 2030 carbon commitments.In 2022, we were able to disaggregate and identify previously unreported electricity for some of our leased datacenters due to improvements in our ability to capture such data.We have revised FY20 and FY21 Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 market and location values to include this additional information.In FY22, we included this activity in our results and procured unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs) to mitigate the increased emissions for FY22.Our year-over-year figures show a 23 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions, which is driven in part by our procurement of RECs for FY22.Without this revision, our Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions would have remained proportional with business growth.|||In 2020, we made a commitment to be water positive by 2030 and co-founded the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC), an industry-driven, CEO-led coalition of the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate to reduce water stress by 2050.For Microsoft, being net water positive means we will reduce water consumption across our global operations, replenish more water than we use, provide people across the globe with access to water and sanitation services, drive innovation, and engage in water policy.Our internal water fee, modeled after our carbon fee, plays a critical role in enabling our progress against our water commitment.The fee was established in FY20 and is used to fund replenishment and access projects around the globe.It is charged to business groups based on annual water consumption projections at a rate that was determined with historical data and guidance from experts on the cost of replenishment projects.The objectives of the fee are to incentivize businesses across Microsoft to take steps to reduce water use and to raise internal awareness of our water positive commitment.We are strengthening how we manage water within Microsoft, while working to improve the way the world evaluates and manages water today and for future generations.|||Every year, people consume 100 billion tons of materials, and in 2020 only 8.6 percent of those materials were cycled back into the economy after use, according to the 2022 Circularity Gap Report.Linear take-make-waste systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy.We recognize the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions associated with the lifecycle of these materials.As a company that manufactures devices, builds campuses and datacenters, and uses manufactured goods in our operations, we have committed to responsibly design and source materials and build a more circular approach into our work and the world.To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft is taking

possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain.In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent.Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) (marketbased and management-defined criteria for Scope 3 Category 11).Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO2e.More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.We saw a 0.5 percent increase in our Scope 3 emissions this year based on investments in real-time device telemetry-based measurement, improvements in our operations and supply chain, and purchases of renewable energy.As the world transitions to a lower-carbon, clean energy economy, we're using our purchasing and investing power to help advance innovation and the development of new solutions-helping us meet our own commitments while catalyzing the creation of broader market supply for others.We fund purchases of renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal through our internal carbon fee, which we established in 2012.The fee is designed to accelerate carbon reduction and allocate funding to projects that jumpstart and scale decarbonization technologies.In FY22, we redesigned and increased our carbon fee to accelerate Scope 3 emissions reduction, tying the fee to the costs abatement for different sources-electricity, fuel, and other emissions.We will continue to evaluate the carbon fee design to align our business operations and 2030 carbon commitments.In 2022, we were able to disaggregate and identify previously unreported electricity for some of our leased datacenters due to improvements in our ability to capture such data.We have revised FY20 and FY21 Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 market and location values to include this additional information.In FY22, we included this activity in our results and procured unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs) to mitigate the increased emissions for FY22.Our year-over-year figures show a 23 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions, which is driven in part by our procurement of RECs for FY22.Without this revision, our Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions would have remained proportional with business growth.|||In 2020, we made a commitment to be water positive by 2030 and co-founded the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC), an industry-driven, CEO-led coalition of the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate to reduce water stress by 2050.For Microsoft, being net water positive means we will reduce water consumption across our global operations, replenish more water than we use, provide people across the globe with access to water and sanitation services, drive innovation, and engage in water policy.Our internal water fee, modeled after our carbon fee, plays a critical role in enabling our progress against our water commitment.The fee was established in FY20 and is used to fund replenishment and access projects around the globe.It is charged to business groups based on annual water consumption projections at a rate that was determined with historical data and guidance from experts on the cost of replenishment projects.The objectives of the fee are to incentivize businesses across Microsoft to take steps to reduce water use and to raise internal awareness of our water positive commitment.We are strengthening how we manage water within Microsoft, while working to improve the way the world evaluates and manages water today and for future generations.|||Every year, people consume 100 billion tons of materials, and in 2020 only 8.6 percent of those materials were cycled back into the economy after use, according to the 2022 Circularity Gap Report.Linear take-make-waste systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy.We recognize the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions associated with the lifecycle of these materials.As a company that manufactures devices, builds campuses and datacenters, and uses manufactured goods in our operations, we have committed to responsibly design and source materials and build a more circular approach into our work and the world.To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft is taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions.Our strategy goes beyond waste diversion as we work across our value chain, beginning with design and material selection.Wherever possible, we reduce the amount of materials needed.We responsibly source materials for our operations, products, and packaging.We are increasing the use of recycled and recyclable content, reducing hazardous substances, and designing out waste.We aim to keep products and materials in use longer through reuse and repair.We reduce waste generation at end of life with recycling and composting programs.We are taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions.|||Microsoft directly operates on approximately 11,000

                "text": "In January 2020, Microsoft committed to be carbon negative by 2030.Operationally, we see this commitment as a journey that starts with reducing carbon emissions as much as possible, replacing our electricity consumption with carbon-free energy, and removing the emissions that remain.In FY22, our business grew by 18 percent and our overall emissions were down 0.5 percent.Our total company emissions were just under 13 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) (marketbased and management-defined criteria for Scope 3 Category 11).Taking into account our renewable energy purchases, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 428,000 mtCO2e.More than 96 percent of our emissions are in Scope 3, which includes emissions from our supply chain, the lifecycle of our hardware and devices, travel, and other indirect sources.We saw a 0.5 percent increase in our Scope 3 emissions this year based on investments in real-time device telemetry-based measurement, improvements in our operations and supply chain, and purchases of renewable energy.As the world transitions to a lower-carbon, clean energy economy, we're using our purchasing and investing power to help advance innovation and the development of new solutions-helping us meet our own commitments while catalyzing the creation of broader market supply for others.We fund purchases of renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal through our internal carbon fee, which we established in 2012.The fee is designed to accelerate carbon reduction and allocate funding to projects that jumpstart and scale decarbonization technologies.In FY22, we redesigned and increased our carbon fee to accelerate Scope 3 emissions reduction, tying the fee to the costs abatement for different sources-electricity, fuel, and other emissions.We will continue to evaluate the carbon fee design to align our business operations and 2030 carbon commitments.In 2022, we were able to disaggregate and identify previously unreported electricity for some of our leased datacenters due to improvements in our ability to capture such data.We have revised FY20 and FY21 Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 market and location values to include this additional information.In FY22, we included this activity in our results and procured unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs) to mitigate the increased emissions for FY22.Our year-over-year figures show a 23 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions, which is driven in part by our procurement of RECs for FY22.Without this revision, our Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions would have remained proportional with business growth.|||In 2020, we made a commitment to be water positive by 2030 and co-founded the Water Resilience Coalition (WRC), an industry-driven, CEO-led coalition of the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate to reduce water stress by 2050.For Microsoft, being net water positive means we will reduce water consumption across our global operations, replenish more water than we use, provide people across the globe with access to water and sanitation services, drive innovation, and engage in water policy.Our internal water fee, modeled after our carbon fee, plays a critical role in enabling our progress against our water commitment.The fee was established in FY20 and is used to fund replenishment and access projects around the globe.It is charged to business groups based on annual water consumption projections at a rate that was determined with historical data and guidance from experts on the cost of replenishment projects.The objectives of the fee are to incentivize businesses across Microsoft to take steps to reduce water use and to raise internal awareness of our water positive commitment.We are strengthening how we manage water within Microsoft, while working to improve the way the world evaluates and manages water today and for future generations.|||Every year, people consume 100 billion tons of materials, and in 2020 only 8.6 percent of those materials were cycled back into the economy after use, according to the 2022 Circularity Gap Report.Linear take-make-waste systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain, collect, and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy.We recognize the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions associated with the lifecycle of these materials.As a company that manufactures devices, builds campuses and datacenters, and uses manufactured goods in our operations, we have committed to responsibly design and source materials and build a more circular approach into our work and the world.To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft is taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions.Our strategy goes beyond waste diversion as we work across our value chain, beginning with design and material selection.Wherever possible, we reduce the amount of materials needed.We responsibly source materials for our operations, products, and packaging.We are increasing the use of recycled and recyclable content, reducing hazardous substances, and designing out waste.We aim to keep products and materials in use longer through reuse and repair.We reduce waste generation at end of life with recycling and composting programs.We are taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions.|||Microsoft directly operates on approximately 11,000 acres of land around the world, and we recognize that our own land footprint has an impact on ecosystems.We have made a commitment to permanently protect more land than we use by 2025.We are also committed to being good stewards of the land we use - as well as going beyond our own operations and actively working to protect the environmental health of the communities that host our datacenter operations and where our employees live and work.land we use to operate.We have contracted to protect 17,268 acres of land, which is over 50 percent more than the|||"
