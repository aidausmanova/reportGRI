## Environment

We are on track to meet our public sustainability commitments including to: (1) halve our emissions by 2030 from a 2019 baseline; and (2) bring our remaining net emissions from 2022 onwards to zero.

- ● We upgraded our Scope 3 target to reduce these emissions 55% per million USD of value added 3  by 2030.
- ● Starting in 2022, we've brought net Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to zero by investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon.

We continue to focus on decarbonizing film and series production. Over the course of 2022:

- ● We've used clean technologies on over 60% of the productions Netflix manages directly; and
- ● We've committed to use at least one electric vehicle (EV) on screen in all of our directly managed productions, and our 'Everybody In' partnership with GM will also help promote their use.

We support creators who choose to incorporate sustainability into their storytelling. 165 million households around the world - over 70% of our members - have chosen to watch one or more stories highlighting climate and/or sustainability. And we spotlight these stories during moments like Earth Month.

2 All data points are for the 2022 calendar year unless otherwise noted.

3 ' Value Added' is a term used by SBTi. For Netflix, this is synonymous with 'Gross Profit,' derived from subtracting 'Cost of Revenues' from 'Total Revenue' for the business, per our public financial statements.

## Social

## As our third Inclusion Report showed:

- ● Women have the highest gender representation at Netflix; and
- ● Over 50% of our US employees are from one or more historically excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.

In April 2023, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published their latest study into representation behind and in front of the camera for Netflix's US films and series. It showed notable improvements for women and people from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups 4 between 2020 and 2021.

In addition, we continue to invest in the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which helps increase opportunities within the entertainment industry.

Our employee giving program provides a 2:1 match on employee donations. In 2022, Netflix and our employees donated $34 million to over 5,000 charities worldwide.

We have now added disclosures about product accessibility to our ESG Report given the importance of ensuring that all of our members - regardless of language, device, connectivity or ability - can enjoy our entertainment.

## Governance

At our 2022 annual meeting, stockholders approved a board proposal to make significant changes to our corporate governance, including:

- ● A phased declassification of our board beginning in 2023. From 2025, our entire board will stand for annual elections;
- ● The elimination of supermajority voting provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws; and
- ● The ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

We've also adopted a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections and evolved our co-CEO compensation program for 2023. This includes: a CEO salary cap; performance-based annual cash bonus; and a minimum 50% of compensation allocated to stock options with one year vesting.

In the last year, Netflix executives have met shareholders representing around 51% of our outstanding shares to solicit their feedback. Independent directors participated in a majority of these meetings.

## Environment

To entertain the world, we need a habitable planet to entertain. We're working to make our operations more sustainable, including behind the camera, and to support creators who want to highlight sustainability on screen.

Sustainability in Our Operations and Value Chain

## Sustainability Strategy

Key is decarbonizing our operations and value chain, which includes the making of our films and series. To help us meet this challenge, we created an advisory group, including scientists and other experts. This group is unpaid and entirely independent (full list available at sustainability.netflix.com).

## Our Public Climate Targets

The science is clear - the next decade is critical if we are to manage climate change sustainably. In March of 2021, we set two near-term climate targets aligned with consensus climate science that can be measured in years, not decades:

Reduce our emissions by roughly half by 2030 ; and

Bring our remaining net emissions from 2022 onwards to zero , in support of global net zero goals, by investing in nature-based solutions that retain and capture carbon.

When we first set our emissions targets, we aligned to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) standard for Scope 3 'supplier engagement' targets 5 . After working to improve our Scope 3 data, we submitted an upgraded quantitative 'intensity' target 6  aligned to current SBTi standards for validation in 2022. The new target, which has now been approved by the SBTi, is to reduce Scope 3 emissions 55% per million USD of value added 7  by 2030.

5 Netflix previously had a science-based target to engage 70% of suppliers to set their own science-based targets.

6 Netflix's Intensity Scope 3 target was approved by SBTi on Feb 27, 2023 (see 'Companies Taking Action' on the SBTi website). Our validated Scope 1 and 2 target remains unchanged from 2021.

7 'Value Added' is a term used by SBTi. For Netflix, this is synonymous with 'Gross Profit,' derived from subtracting 'Cost of Revenues' from 'Total Revenue' for the business, per our public financial statements.
