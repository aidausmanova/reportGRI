        "comment": " The paragraph provides a reasonable level of detail on the diversity initiatives in place, including governance bodies and employees. It discusses various aspects of diversity and inclusion, such as age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and cultural background. However, it lacks specific examples or quantitative data to fully illustrate the effectiveness of the initiatives. The materiality is scored higher as the paragraph demonstrates the clear relevance of diversity and inclusion to the company's culture, strategy, and governance. It also highlights the various committees, councils, and initiatives in place, indicating alignment",

        "comment": " The disclosure partially addresses the GRI disclosure by mentioning the oversight and review processes for political contributions and public policy activities. However, it lacks specific details such as the actual amounts of contributions, the recipients of the contributions, and the specific areas of public policy the company engages in. The disclosure also lacks depth in explaining the company's approach to political contributions and the potential impacts on stakeholders.The materiality score is low because while the paragraph mentions oversight and compliance procedures, it does not clearly demonstrate why political contributions and public policy activities are important to the business",
