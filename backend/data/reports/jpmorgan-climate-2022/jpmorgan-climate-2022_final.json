CEO", "text": "providers need to invest to achieve net-zero emissions.To support clients, we established the Center for Carbon Transition, centralizing client access to financing, advisory and research solutions to help them make the low-carbon transition and thrive.As I said in my annual letter to shareholders last April, despite the growth in well-intended climate pledges from governments and companies, the world is well short of meeting its net-zero emissions goals by 2050.At the same time, resource scarcity is leading to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerable.Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent, global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint.These objectives are not mutually exclusive.We can - and must - do both.To begin, we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of an appropriate climate approach.Last April, I set out four ways to jump-start that process.These have as much validity today as they did over six months ago:First, we must promote energy security.Constraining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine rages on, is a bad idea.The world still needs oil and natural gas today.But not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon footprint.We should be directing more capital toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and investing in innovations, such as carbon capture and sequestration, as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for society.JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expediting the use of lower-carbon fuels.We don't boycott companies - we believe capitalSecond, we need to scale investment massively in clean technologies.As the International Energy Agency has emphasized, 'huge leaps in clean energy innovation' are core to achieving net zero.This is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean hydrogen, are fully available.To accelerate progress, JPMorgan Chase set a target to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over ten years to advance sustainable development, including $1 trillion for climate action and other green initiatives with approximately $106 billion green activities financed in 2021.Third, while businesses have important roles to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, the private sector cannot do this alone.Public sector leadership is needed to enact policies that spur long-term and large-scale capital deployment for low-carbon solutions that benefit the global economy, including measures like promoting investment in technology R&amp;D and reductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastructure, such as wind and solar farms, transmission lines and liquefied natural gas.Finally, let's set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions today.This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas.Immediately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing, not less, to prepare companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future.In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio, starting with Oil &amp; Gas, Electric Power, and Automotive Manufacturing - and now we are establishing three new sectoral goals for Iron &amp; Steel, Cement and Aviation.It's worth noting that while we make our own decisions for our company, we may work with coalitions or join organizations that seek to advance progress.At the end of the day, our climate ambitions are subject to important prerequisites and considerations, both within and outside of our control, including energy security, investment in innovation, appropriate climate policy, and our own views about orderly transition.It is in this context that we are pleased to present our 2022 Climate Report, which outlines the measures we are taking to respond to the climate challenge across our business.We remain committed to addressing energy and climate challenges as part of how we do business and serve our customers, clients, shareholders, and communities each day.There is no silver bullet to meet the world's energy and climate goals.But we can start by prioritizing emissions reductions, developing meaningful short- and long-term goals and crafting innovative policy solutions.The curve toward net zero can still be bent before it's too late."}]}, {"topic": "gri_2-strategy", "topic_title": "General Disclosures: Strategy, Risk, and Stakeholder Engagement", "disclosure": "gri_2-28", "disclosure_code": "GRI 2-28", "disclosure_title": "Membership associations (industry peers)", "section_ids": ["jpmorgan-climate-2022-87"], "completeness": 8, "materiality": 9, "comment": " The paragraph provides a detailed description of the company's engagement with industry peers and membership associations, including specific examples of recent climate-related public policy and industry engagements.

and- \u00b7 House price impacts: cumulative effect of climate-driven events may adversely impact house prices and local economies in certain geographies, potentially disproportionately impacting lower-income households and communities.Additionally, we are examining how the transition to a low-carbon economy may create financial burden on consumers from potentially higher energy prices, pass-through of carbon taxes on goods and services, or result in declines in the value of other assets (e.g., gas-burning vehicles), which could impact consumers' ability to repay and may result in additional credit losses to the Firm."}, {"section_idx": "jpmorgan-climate-2022-54", "title": "CCB EV AUTO LENDING", "text": "At J.P.Morgan Asset Management ('JPMAM'), we believe contributing to solutions to tackle climate change creates longterm value for our clients.For this reason, we continually strive to enhance our climate-related investment capabilities and our efforts to help clients consider the material implications of climate change within their portfolios.JPMAM's Global Sustainable Investing Team leads sustainable investing globally in partnership with investment professionals to meet client needs.The team: provides investing research and insights on thematic ESG issues;

CEO", "text": "providers need to invest to achieve net-zero emissions.To support clients, we established the Center for Carbon Transition, centralizing client access to financing, advisory and research solutions to help them make the low-carbon transition and thrive.As I said in my annual letter to shareholders last April, despite the growth in well-intended climate pledges from governments and companies, the world is well short of meeting its net-zero emissions goals by 2050.At the same time, resource scarcity is leading to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerable.Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent, global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint.These objectives are not mutually exclusive.We can - and must - do both.To begin, we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of an appropriate climate approach.Last April, I set out four ways to jump-start that process.These have as much validity today as they did over six months ago:First, we must promote energy security.Constraining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine rages on, is a bad idea.The world still needs oil and natural gas today.But not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon footprint.We should be directing more capital toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and investing in innovations, such as carbon capture and sequestration, as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for society.JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expediting the use of lower-carbon fuels.We don't boycott companies - we believe capitalSecond, we need to scale investment massively in clean technologies.As the International Energy Agency has emphasized, 'huge leaps in clean energy innovation' are core to achieving net zero.This is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean hydrogen, are fully available.To accelerate progress, JPMorgan Chase set a target to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over ten years to advance sustainable development, including $1 trillion for climate action and other green initiatives with approximately $106 billion green activities financed in 2021.Third, while businesses have important roles to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, the private sector cannot do this alone.Public sector leadership is needed to enact policies that spur long-term and large-scale capital deployment for low-carbon solutions that benefit the global economy, including measures like promoting investment in technology R&amp;D and reductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastructure, such as wind and solar farms, transmission lines and liquefied natural gas.Finally, let's set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions today.This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas.Immediately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing, not less, to prepare companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future.In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio, starting with Oil &amp; Gas, Electric Power, and Automotive Manufacturing - and now we are establishing three new sectoral goals for Iron &amp; Steel, Cement and Aviation.It's worth noting that while we make our own decisions for our company, we may work with coalitions or join organizations that seek to advance progress.At the end of the day, our climate ambitions are subject to important prerequisites and considerations, both within and outside of our control, including energy security, investment in innovation, appropriate climate policy, and our own views about orderly transition.It is in this context that we are pleased to present our 2022 Climate Report, which outlines the measures we are taking to respond to the climate challenge across our business.We remain committed to addressing energy and climate challenges as part of how we do business and serve our customers, clients, shareholders, and communities each day.There is no silver bullet to meet the world's energy and climate goals.But we can start by prioritizing emissions reductions, developing meaningful short- and long-term goals and crafting innovative policy solutions.The curve toward net zero can still be bent before it's too late."}, {"section_idx": "jpmorgan-climate-2022-79", "title": "Our Emissions Reduction Pathway", "text": "To build on our commitment to carbon-neutral operations, in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location based) emissions by 40% by 2030 versus a 2017 baseline.As of the end of 2021, we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 location-based emissions by 17%.Moving forward, we intend to make further progress by increasing our direct use of renewable energy, upgrading existing heating and cooling systems, and optimizing building space.Over time, as we strive to reduce our operational emissions through these measures, we anticipate needing to buy fewer carbon credits to neutralize our emissions.Highlights of our recent emissions reduction efforts include the following:- \u00b7 Data center efficiency.The Firm continues to implement improvements across its data centers by shifting information technology load to newer, more efficient data centers.We also endeavor to share what we have learned with others.For instance, in October 2021, we joined the Low Carbon Patent Pledge, through which we will share several key patents related to how we efficiently cool and ventilate our data centers, with the aim of helping to speed the transition to low-carbon technology and energy sources.- \u00b7 24/7 renewable energy.In 2021, we worked with energy provider EDF to power our buildings in the United Kingdom ('U.K.') with renewable energy around the clock.As part of this effort, our electricity consumption in the U.K.will be matched to renewable generation every minute of the day, providing us with approximately 120,000 megawatt hours ('MWh') of renewable electricity each year enough to power our three million square feet of offices in the U.K., or the equivalent of about 33,000 homes.- \u00b7 Solar expansion.We continue to expand on-site solar power at our corporate office buildings and retail branches across the U.S.As of December 31, 2021, we have added solar installations at nearly 300 retail branches in nine states including Arizona, California, Ohio and New York.Our goal is to complete solar installations at approximately 400 additional branches and 125 carports, totaling over 25 megawatts ('MW') of solar capacity.We are also expanding solar installations at our corporate office buildings and expect to deploy approximately 90 MW of additional solar capacity.- \u00b7 Net zero branch pilot.In 2022, we opened a Chase retail branch in Pico Rivera, California that is piloting a net zero carbon design.Built from the ground up, the new branch will incorporate a full range of low-carbon technologies and building techniques including a wood frame modular design, low-carbon concrete, enhanced insulation, rooftop solar arrays, full electrification and the use of reclaimed asphalt in the parking lots.We expect to purchase carbon credits to address any emissions associated with construction that cannot be mitigated via sustainable design.The branch is undergoing an intensive 12-month energy performance analysis to provide insights that can inform our approach to designing and retrofitting other branches in the future.For more information related to our emissions data and renewable energy use, see Metrics &amp;

CEO", "text": "providers need to invest to achieve net-zero emissions.To support clients, we established the Center for Carbon Transition, centralizing client access to financing, advisory and research solutions to help them make the low-carbon transition and thrive.As I said in my annual letter to shareholders last April, despite the growth in well-intended climate pledges from governments and companies, the world is well short of meeting its net-zero emissions goals by 2050.At the same time, resource scarcity is leading to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerable.Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent, global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint.These objectives are not mutually exclusive.We can - and must - do both.To begin, we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of an appropriate climate approach.Last April, I set out four ways to jump-start that process.These have as much validity today as they did over six months ago:First, we must promote energy security.Constraining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine rages on, is a bad idea.The world still needs oil and natural gas today.But not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon footprint.We should be directing more capital toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and investing in innovations, such as carbon capture and sequestration, as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for society.JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expediting the use of lower-carbon fuels.We don't boycott companies - we believe capitalSecond, we need to scale investment massively in clean technologies.As the International Energy Agency has emphasized, 'huge leaps in clean energy innovation' are core to achieving net zero.This is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean hydrogen, are fully available.To accelerate progress, JPMorgan Chase set a target to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over ten years to advance sustainable development, including $1 trillion for climate action and other green initiatives with approximately $106 billion green activities financed in 2021.Third, while businesses have important roles to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, the private sector cannot do this alone.Public sector leadership is needed to enact policies that spur long-term and large-scale capital deployment for low-carbon solutions that benefit the global economy, including measures like promoting investment in technology R&amp;D and reductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastructure, such as wind and solar farms, transmission lines and liquefied natural gas.Finally, let's set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions today.This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas.Immediately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing, not less, to prepare companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future.In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio, starting with Oil &amp; Gas, Electric Power, and Automotive Manufacturing - and now we are establishing three new sectoral goals for Iron &amp; Steel, Cement and Aviation.It's worth noting that while we make our own decisions for our company, we may work with coalitions or join organizations that seek to advance progress.At the end of the day, our climate ambitions are subject to important prerequisites and considerations, both within and outside of our control, including energy security, investment in innovation, appropriate climate policy, and our own views about orderly transition.It is in this context that we are pleased to present our 2022 Climate Report, which outlines the measures we are taking to respond to the climate challenge across our business.We remain committed to addressing energy and climate challenges as part of how we do business and serve our customers, clients, shareholders, and communities each day.There is no silver bullet to meet the world's energy and climate goals.But we can start by prioritizing emissions reductions, developing meaningful short- and long-term goals and crafting innovative policy solutions.The curve toward net zero can still be bent before it's too late."}, {"section_idx": "jpmorgan-climate-2022-158", "title": "Looking Ahead", "text": "As a global financial institution, we can play an important role in helping to respond to the climate challenge and meeting the world's energy needs.We are supporting clients across sectors and building our own capabilities to help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.Moving forward, we will plan to expand our efforts across the pillars of our environmental sustainability strategy, including:\u2022Enhancing climate-related disclosures by publishing Scope 3 absolute financed emissions next year, continuing to set portfolio-level targets for additional sectors, and re-evaluating our targets for the Oil &amp;

Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing - and published our Carbon Compass SM (2021) methodology detailing our approach.We also announced our plans to expand our targets to additional sectors of our financing portfolio over time.We are now setting net-zero aligned targets for three additional sectors - Iron &amp; Steel, Cement and Aviation - building on the approach and foundation we set with our initial three sectors.Our new targets are intended to align to the International Energy Agency's ('IEA') Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario ('NZE').We chose to address these three sectors next given their contribution to total global emissions, and in consideration of the technical and economic maturity of their available decarbonization pathways.We believe expansion to additional sectors also helps us further sharpen our focus on the interplay between the supply and demand sides of the global energy system, which is vital to advancing overall decarbonization and the global path to net-zero emissions.For example, by understanding evolving technologies and approaches in both the Electric Power sector and major industrial sectors pursuing electrification, we believe we are better positioned to meet the needs of both types of clients, including helping them seize opportunities to accelerate and strengthen their transition strategies.We aim to continue expanding this work over time for additional carbon-intensive sectors, engaging with our clients on their decarbonization journeys, and aligning that work with global climate goals and evolving best practices for the financial sector.This Climate Report provides an opportunity to reflect on our progress to date, including how we have been implementing our existing targets and expanding our approach to additional sectors.Below we summarize key elements of our approach and our strategy for driving progress toward our targets, while in the Metrics &amp;
