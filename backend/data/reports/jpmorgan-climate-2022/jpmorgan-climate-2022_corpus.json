    "text": "providers need to invest to achieve net-zero emissions.To support clients, we established the Center for Carbon Transition, centralizing client access to financing, advisory and research solutions to help them make the low-carbon transition and thrive.As I said in my annual letter to shareholders last April, despite the growth in well-intended climate pledges from governments and companies, the world is well short of meeting its net-zero emissions goals by 2050.At the same time, resource scarcity is leading to higher energy costs and reduced reliability, hindering national security and hurting the most vulnerable.Disruptions to the global energy system are again highlighting our urgent, global need to provide energy resources securely, reliably and affordably and, at the same time, address long-term clean energy solutions and strategies to reduce our carbon footprint.These objectives are not mutually exclusive.We can - and must - do both.To begin, we need to find a better way forward that can bring diverse stakeholders together in pursuit of an appropriate climate approach.Last April, I set out four ways to jump-start that process.These have as much validity today as they did over six months ago:First, we must promote energy security.Constraining the flow of capital needed to produce and move fuels, especially as the war in Ukraine rages on, is a bad idea.The world still needs oil and natural gas today.But not all hydrocarbons are equal when it comes to their carbon footprint.We should be directing more capital toward less carbon-intensive fuel sources and investing in innovations, such as carbon capture and sequestration, as we look to transition to green technologies delivered at scale for society.JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to helping finance these kinds of investments and expediting the use of lower-carbon fuels.We don't boycott companies - we believe capitalSecond, we need to scale investment massively in clean technologies.As the International Energy Agency has emphasized, 'huge leaps in clean energy innovation' are core to achieving net zero.This is because the world will rely on traditional fuels until alternatives, like clean hydrogen, are fully available.To accelerate progress, JPMorgan Chase set a target to finance and facilitate $2.5 trillion over ten years to advance sustainable development, including $1 trillion for climate action and other green initiatives with approximately $106 billion green activities financed in 2021.Third, while businesses have important roles to play in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, the private sector cannot do this alone.Public sector leadership is needed to enact policies that spur long-term and large-scale capital deployment for low-carbon solutions that benefit the global economy, including measures like promoting investment in technology R&amp;D and reductions in permitting timelines for energy infrastructure, such as wind and solar farms, transmission lines and liquefied natural gas.Finally, let's set meaningful goals and identify a few tangible, cost-effective solutions to reduce emissions today.This should include minimizing fugitive methane emissions and virtually eliminating wasteful flaring of natural gas.Immediately actionable opportunities like these might require more financing, not less, to prepare companies to thrive in a lower-carbon future.In 2021, JPMorgan Chase set 2030 targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolio, starting with Oil &amp; Gas, Electric Power, and Automotive Manufacturing - and now we are establishing three new sectoral goals for Iron &amp; Steel, Cement and Aviation.It's worth noting that while we make our own decisions for our company, we may work with coalitions or join organizations that seek to advance progress.At the end of the day, our climate ambitions are subject to important prerequisites and considerations, both within and outside of our control, including energy security, investment in innovation, appropriate climate policy, and our own views about orderly transition.It is in this context that we are pleased to present our 2022 Climate Report, which outlines the measures we are taking to respond to the climate challenge across our business.We remain committed to addressing energy and climate challenges as part of how we do business and serve our customers, clients, shareholders, and communities each day.There is no silver bullet to meet the world's energy and climate goals.But we can start by prioritizing emissions reductions, developing meaningful short- and long-term goals and crafting innovative policy solutions.The curve toward net zero can still be bent before it's too late.",

and- \u00b7 Contributing to the Business Roundtable's submission to the Environmental Protection Agency advocating methane emission reductions standards for the Oil &amp; Gas sector.The Firm belongs to a number of trade associations that advocate on major public policy issues of importance to the Firm and the communities we serve.The Firm's participation in these associations comes with the understanding that we may not always align with all their positions or those of its other members.We are committed to independent decision-making at the Firm and providing appropriate feedback on the efforts by these associations, including where there is misalignment between the Firm's climate objectives and trade association positions or activities.A list of the Firm's principal trade associations is disclosed in our Political Engagement Report.Similarly, the Firm may engage with industry initiatives to help address complex global challenges, including climate change, where we are aligned with the initiatives' goals and can continue to exercise our own business judgment based on the best interest of the Firm.We participate in a variety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability where we share our expertise and learn from other companies and organizations.Three examples are- \u00b7 In October 2021, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA'), which brings together a global network of banks committed to considering their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050.Participation in NZBA is part of our effort as we work to develop our own targets for other sectors and engage with a growing number of clients who are aligning their strategies with science-based emission reduction pathways.It is also a reflection of our support for the ambition of greater climate action.While we are committed to these objectives, we also have noted that NZBA sets a high bar and its goals are subject to other prerequisites and critical considerations, both within and outside our control.These include the necessity of technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behavior and demand, and the need for thoughtful climate polices - all factors required to make achievement of targets feasible - as well as the potential impact of legal and regulatory obligations and the challenge of balancing our commitment to short-term targets with the need to facilitate an orderly and just transition and energy security.As we engage with NZBA and other industry initiatives to which our efforts are aligned, the Firm will continue to make independent decisions that we believe are best for the long-term success of our business.- \u00b7 We are working to advance climate resilience solutions.For example, with our support, the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center hosted a Resilience Hub at COP26 in Glasgow to build awareness and foster global action to build climate resilience, attracting speakers from 176 participating organizations and over 10,000 visitors.The center-sponsored research has identified challenges from extreme heat, including inequitable public health impacts and significant economic productivity loss.We are also supporting a new center-led initiative called 'Cool Capital' to identify and quantify opportunities to channel multiple types of capital into on-the-ground solutions to mitigate the effects of extreme heat on people in 12 cities around the world.- \u00b7 We continue to work with Oil &amp; Gas industry participants, the public sector, and non-governmental organizations ('NGOs') to support improved methane data quality.For example, we engage with the Oil &amp; Gas Methane Partnership, as part of our broader efforts to explore opportunities for industry clients, technology innovators, and data providers to accelerate direct measurement technologies as a preferred method of tracking and reporting methane emissions.",

    "text": "Credit &amp; investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in the credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer, or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments.We leverage our risk identification and scenario analysis to measure the potential adverse impacts the baseline and severe climate risk scenarios may have on our credit portfolios, both today and into the future.We are analyzing the direct impacts of transition and physical risk - considering property damage and financial loss due to extreme weather events or the potential reduction in profitability of a client, counterparty or customer as a result of transitioning from a high-carbon to a lower carbon-intensive footprint.We are also considering indirect and longer-term risk drivers, including the potential for change in cost or availability of insurance for physical risks in a given geography, permanent loss or structural changes to consumer preferences.As of December 31, 2021, the Firm had $1.3 trillion of consumer credit exposure, including residential real estate, auto loans and credit cards.The Firm is using catastrophe models to quantify the hypothetical physical damage from various climate- and weather-driven events and applying it to our real estate portfolios to estimate potential financial loss.For example, residential real estate loans made up $225 billion of the total consumer credit portfolio, predominantly in the U.S.Today, climate-related risks for this portfolio are substantially mitigated through geographic diversification of the properties, the prevalence of hazard insurance, and the effective average life of the underlying loans, among other factors.As a result, financial losses due to natural disasters and weather events have not been material to the Firm.As we examine the potential for future impacts, we may consider outcomes in which these mitigants are weakened - for example, if insurance becomes less prevalent.The map below shows, at the U.S.county level, the modeled potential increase in property damage due to flooding in 2050 under RCP 8.5 compared to 2020.This includes the impact of heavy rainfall, riverine flooding and storm surges, but assumes that no future mitigation steps are taken (such as improving flood defenses).Third-party analysis such as this helps the Firm to assess the potential susceptibility of our credit portfolio to these events.This map was derived utilizing an external risk-based software analytics tool.The cumulative effect of physical climate risk may impact our residential real estate portfolio in several ways, including the following:- \u00b7 Greater physical damages: increased likelihood or severity of extreme weather events may increase consumer credit losses;- \u00b7 Higher insurance premiums: higher insurance premiums may increase living expenses and financial burden for consumers;- \u00b7 Reduced coverage or availability of insurance: insurers may further limit types of damage they cover or withdraw coverage from specific geographies; and- \u00b7 House price impacts: cumulative effect of climate-driven events may adversely impact house prices and local economies in certain geographies, potentially disproportionately impacting lower-income households and communities.Additionally, we are examining how the transition to a low-carbon economy may create financial burden on consumers from potentially higher energy prices, pass-through of carbon taxes on goods and services, or result in declines in the value of other assets (e.g., gas-burning vehicles), which could impact consumers' ability to repay and may result in additional credit losses to the Firm.",
