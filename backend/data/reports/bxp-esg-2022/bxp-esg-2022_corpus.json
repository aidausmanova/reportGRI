        "text": "In partnership with our vendors and clients , BXP has implemented best waste management practices , including single-stream recycling , composting , and e-waste programs for solid waste in all our regions . As a result , 47.3 % of office waste by weight is recycled , donated , or composted across our portfolio , which is a 31.3 % increase since 2008 .\nWe also work closely with our vendors and clients to promote responsible waste management practices , including haul trip optimization and composting at caf\u00e9s and restaurants . In 2016 we established a bold commitment to achieving a 65 % diversion rate by 2020 . Unfortunately , we fell short of that goal by a margin of approximately 10 % .\nDiversion has become more challenging as the economics of recycling have become less favorable and waste haulers have become more discerning regarding contamination ( recycling that contains non-recyclable materials ) . Going forward , we will perform more auditing of waste streams , engage clients to promote recycling , and will make efforts to introduce composting at more sites .\nIn 2021 , we reset our waste diversion target to 60 % by 2025 . Single-Stream Recycling: We have worked across our portfolio with our clients and waste haulers to transition to single-stream recycling programs . Single-stream simplifies recycling . Commingled materials are collected in one container and sorted offsite at a material recovery facility . The advantages of single-stream recycling include increased client participation and potentially higher waste diversion rates . Composting: Our integrated composting program diverted nearly 1,282 tons of organic material from landfills in 2022 . We work with our clients to ensure that they have signage and receptacles , and that our buildings have designated central compost bins with frequently scheduled pickup .\nComposting produces valuable nutrient-rich soil , avoids potentially significant methane emissions , and reduces the frequency of waste hauls required .",

Much of our new construction involves the redevelopment of existing sites , which conserves natural areas and habitats .\nIn some cases , the redevelopment of sites involves the remediation of soil and water contamination caused by industrial activities by others . We design buildings to minimize light pollution which increases night sky access and reduces the consequences of development for wildlife and people .\nWhen we install site lighting , we typically model light levels and specify fixtures that minimize the trespass of light beyond the site boundary . We are also committed to supporting biodiversity by maintaining tree canopy cover and vegetated areas .

        "text": "As developers and managers of buildings , and occupiers of many of those buildings , we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health . In 2018 , we announced a partnership with Fitwel , a leading healthy building certification system , to support healthy building design and operational practices across our portfolio and became a Fitwel Champion .\nSince then , we have certified 21.3 million square feet of our portfolio under the Fitwel rating system . The aim has been to ground healthy building claims in science by quantifying the benefits of superior air quality , water purity and access , building material composition , indoor environments , and wellness amenities .\nWe have exceeded our Fitwel Champion commitments and were named a Best in Building Health award winner in 2020 , 2022 , and 2023 .\nThese awards were earned for executing more Fitwel certifications by count and building area than any other company in 2019 ( 2020 award ) , certifying more Fitwel Viral Response assets than any other company in 2021 ( 2022 award ) , and having the highest square footage of Fitwel certified space in 2022 ( 2023 award ) .\nBXP has three Fitwel Ambassadors among our Sustainability , Development , and Property Management teams . We are advancing the following healthy building strategies to promote the positive impact of buildings on human health . Indoor Air Quality ( IAQ ) refers to the air quality within and around a building as it relates to the health and comfort of the occupants . At BXP , we are committed to developing and maintaining sustainable properties while simultaneously providing healthy indoor environments for our clients , employees , contractors , and other visitors at our properties .\nAs part of a smart-building strategy , our management and engineering teams use real-time energy consumption data to optimize facility operations , including IAQ , and to control energy consumption , carbon emissions , and utility costs . Increasingly , the energy we are using is from renewable sources . Monitoring: BXP manages thermal comfort and air distribution by continuously monitoring space temperature set points and HVAC equipment performance using advanced building management systems . Rigorous air and water quality testing is conducted biannually at a minimum , with samples taken from throughout the building . Results available upon request . Fresh air rate: BXP has confirmed that all base building systems are capable of exceeding the ventilation standard , ASHRAE 62.1 . The median fresh air rate capacity at BXP office properties is 36 CFM per person at 200 square feet per person ( 54 CFM at 300 square feet per person ) . Healthy building certification: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic , BXP achieved Fitwel Viral Response Module enterprise certification and building-level certification at all actively managed office properties . The Viral Response Module was created to operationalize policies and practices to mitigate the spread of infectious disease in buildings . MERV filtration: All of our properties are provided with filtration which is certified to at least a MERV-13 rating and to a MERV-14 or MERV-15 rating .HEPA Filters: Portable hospital grade HEPA filters are provided in our amenity conference rooms , cafes , and fitness centers . Consumption: Our management and engineering teams use real-time energy consumption data to optimize facility operations and control utility costs . Since 2008 we 've reduced operational energy intensity by 39 % and water intensity by 45 % . Today , 86 % of our portfolio is LEED , ENERGY STAR , and/or Fitwel certified . 27 M SF of which is at the highest LEED Gold & amp ; Platinum levels . Green Cleaning: All regions have formalized a Green Cleaning requirement with our cleaning vendors to minimize the impact of cleaning products on the environment . Aspects of this requirement include using Green Seal \u00ae certified cleaning products , High-Efficiency Particulate Air ( HEPA ) vacuums , dry cleaning for carpets , and restroom supply products made from recycled materials .\nOur Green Cleaning program benefits both the janitorial workers within our buildings and our clients because the cleaning methods and products used do not include toxic chemicals that can cause respiratory and dermatological problems . Indoor air quality has also improved because of the use of HEPA vacuums .\nLIVING GREEN WALLS | As part of our healthy building and IAQ strategy , several BXP buildings include living green walls as an amenity in our lobbies . Living green walls offer many benefits , including purifying the air , increasing well-being , reducing ambient noise and temperature , and offering a healing environment .",
