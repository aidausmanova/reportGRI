We used McKinsey Climate Resilience Analytics downscaled CMIP5 models , as well as data from the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and WindRisk Tech .\nThe forecasted future impacts do not represent a substantive safety , financial , or strategic impact above the 4 % threshold on revenues .\nTransition risks : We have assessed current regulation , emerging regulation , legal , market , reputational , and technological risks across short , medium , and long-term horizons and different scenarios ( including the UN Principles for Responsible Investment 's ( UNPRI ) Inevitable Policy Response 's `` Required Policy Scenario '' ) where relevant .\nWe do not expect the cost of the transition risks to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as they do not cross the materiality threshold of 4 % of overall revenues . b .\nDescribe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization 's businesses , strategy , and financial planning strategy , and financial planning ( C2.3a , C2.4a , C3.2b , C3.3 , C3.4 ) : Products and services : In 2021 , we launched our new client service platform , \u201c McKinsey Sustainability , \u201d with the goal of helping all industry sectors transform to reach net zero by 2050 along with other sustainability goals and tailored to regional contexts .\nWe use our thought leadership , innovative tools and solutions , top talent , and a vibrant ecosystem of industry associations and knowledge platforms focused on innovating to net zero .\nOur plans focus on four key levers of decarbonization : helping clients drive a `` brown to green '' transition of the global economy 's installed base , building new green businesses and innovations , retiring and repurposing the highest carbon intensity assets , and scaling nature-based solutions .\nSupply chain and/or value chain : Climate-related risks and opportunities-including reputational ( for example , expectations of colleagues and clients ) , regulatory ( for example , carbon tax ) , and physical ( for example , risk to our buildings due to severe weather ) have influenced our strategy .\nThese risks and opportunities will continue to impact our supply chain strategy in the short , medium , and long term . Because indirect emissions from travel typically account for more than 80 % of our carbon footprint , 57 we have made engaging with our travel-related suppliers a priority . Learn more about our supplier engagement in 2022 .\nInvestment in research and development ( R & D ) : We believe that the climate crisis is a defining issue of our time , so in 2021 , we committed to investing $ 1 billion in our capabilities over the next five years to help our clients lead a wave of innovation and growth to safeguard our planet .\nWe work with leading institutions to develop distinctive thought leadership and convene partnerships that tackle problems that institutions can not tackle alone . Operations : As a global firm , we have set 2025 validated SBTs and committed to net-zero climate impact by 2030 .\nEach region has an SBT regional leader ( senior partner level ) who is accountable for achieving our 2025 near-term SBTs to ensure we meet our commitments . Revenue : Climate change is leading companies to manage risks and seize opportunities , driving increased demand for management consultancy and advisory services on sustainability .\nThis increased demand for our expertise has a positive impact on our client service and revenue . The impact is currently moderate and is expected to increase in line with the global transition to a low-carbon economy , although it has not been deemed to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm . This is evaluated in short-term financial planning .\nWe are actively engaged with this challenge every day . In 2022 , 3,500+ colleagues partnered with 600+ clients on 1,600+ sustainability-related client engagements across nearly 60 countries . Assets : As an advisory firm , our `` assets '' are not physical locations or business units in the traditional sense , but our proprietary knowledge and our reputation .\nWe continue to make a substantial investment in research and knowledge building . This is factored into our financial planning , in developing an understanding of a wide range of sustainability and resource productivity topics with the investment in research and knowledge building .\nThis is factored into our financial planning , in developing an understanding of a wide range of sustainability and resource productivity topics with the aim of informing and progressing the debate with an independent fact base , tools and frameworks , and analysis of risks and opportunities .\nThe impact of these activities is low in comparison to the company-wide financial planning process and has not been deemed to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm in the short term . Capital expenditure : We have committed to 2025 SBTs and net-zero climate impact by 2030 . We have also been carbon neutral since 2018 .\nTherefore , capital expenditures and investments in energy-efficient buildings are included in the financial planning process . Acquisitions and divestments : McKinsey acquired Sweden-based Material Economics , experts in sustainability and circularity in December 2021 .

Our scenario analysis included three point-in-time calculations in 2025 , 2030 , and 2050 . The main source of these emissions is business travel ( approximately 80 % of firm emissions in 2019 ) .\nAs part of our analysis , forecasted carbon prices from UNPRI 's `` Required Policy Scenario '' were weighted across geographies based on our emissions .\nAccording to UNPRI 's , 'Required Policy Scenario '' , carbon prices of $ 45-85 per ton and $ 87-175 per ton will be needed by 2030 and 2050 respectively : Carbon pricing from regulations are not likely to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as we do not operate in an emissions-intensive industry and we have committed to reaching net zero by 2030 .\nPeople and physical assets most exposed : As a global firm that operates in 65+ countries , we have offices that are likely to be exposed to both acute and chronic physical risks in the near , colleagues are based in metropolitan areas that may be exposed to severe flooding globally and approximately 12.5K to hurricanes , especially in the Eastern US and Western Pacific .\nDespite these business- Effect on sectors we serve : We work with clients across sectors , sizes , and geographies . To assess the climate transition and physical impacts on the companies we serve , we conducted scenario analysis using Planetrics , our climate analytics suite .\nanalysis evaluated the impacts of decarbonization on the average valuations of companies in the sectors and regional industries that we serve The analysis included three scenarios : the Required Policy Response ( to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100 ) , the Forecasted Policy Response to limit and in helping grow new green industries help our clients identify opportunities and take bold action .",

Assessment : Our collective risk management functions are overseen by our chief risk officer .\nThe risk management functions routinely and systematically undertake risk assessments , which include climate where relevant .

Any physical security risk to the well-being of our colleagues takes precedence over any other risk .\nMateriality is determined by a combination of factors , such as the ability to impact 4 % of firm revenue , client relationships , and the ability to attract and retain colleagues .

Central to our climate risk management is our risk framework , which provides the insight , integration , and technology we need to anticipate and proactively address risks .\nWe are in the process of enhancing our climate risk identification and assessment capabilities , for example , with the recent incorporation of more advanced scenario analysis into our climate reporting . We continually seek ways to better identify , analyze , and mitigate risk .\nProviding strategic direction for the management of climate-related risks is our Shareholders \u2019 Council , akin to a board of directors .",
