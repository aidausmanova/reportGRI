Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified ( C2.1a , C2.3 , C2.3a , C2.4 , C2.4a ) : We consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the short ( 0-2 years ) , medium ( 2-5 years ) , and long ( 5+ years ) term as part of our business strategy .\nRisks In our climate-related risk assessments , we have considered current regulation , emerging regulation , legal , market , technological , and reputational risks , as well as acute and chronic physical risks .\nBased on input from McKinsey 's internal functions , sustainability practice experts , and others , we have not identified inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm .\nclimate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short , medium , and long term Risks : In our climate-related risk assessments , we have considered current regulation , emerging regulation , legal , market , technological , and reputational risks , as well as acute and chronic physical risks .\nBased on input from McKinsey 's internal functions , sustainability practice experts , and others , we have not identified inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm .\nPhysical risks : As a global firm that operates in 65+ countries , we have offices that are likely to be exposed to both acute and chronic physical risks in the near , medium , and long term .\nIn our analysis , we assessed the impact of physical risks , including riverine and coastal flooding , extreme heat , and hurricanes , aligned to different climate pathways ( 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius ) . We used McKinsey Climate Resilience Analytics downscaled CMIP5 models , as well as data from the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and WindRisk Tech .\nThe forecasted future impacts do not represent a substantive safety , financial , or strategic impact above the 4 % threshold on revenues .\nTransition risks : We have assessed current regulation , emerging regulation , legal , market , reputational , and technological risks across short , medium , and long-term horizons and different scenarios ( including the UN Principles for Responsible Investment 's ( UNPRI ) Inevitable Policy Response 's `` Required Policy Scenario '' ) where relevant .\nWe do not expect the cost of the transition risks to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as they do not cross the materiality threshold of 4 % of overall revenues . b .\nDescribe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization 's businesses , strategy , and financial planning strategy , and financial planning ( C2.3a , C2.4a , C3.2b , C3.3 , C3.4 ) : Products and services : In 2021 , we launched our new client service platform , \u201c McKinsey Sustainability , \u201d with the goal of helping all industry sectors transform to reach net zero by 2050 along with other sustainability goals and tailored to regional contexts .\nWe use our thought leadership , innovative tools and solutions , top talent , and a vibrant ecosystem of industry associations and knowledge platforms focused on innovating to net zero .\nOur plans focus on four key levers of decarbonization : helping clients drive a `` brown to green '' transition of the global economy 's installed base , building new green businesses and innovations , retiring and repurposing the highest carbon intensity assets , and scaling nature-based solutions .\nSupply chain and/or value chain : Climate-related risks and opportunities-including reputational ( for example , expectations of colleagues and clients ) , regulatory ( for example , carbon tax ) , and physical ( for example , risk to our buildings due to severe weather ) have influenced our strategy .\nThese risks and opportunities will continue to impact our supply chain strategy in the short , medium , and long term . Because indirect emissions from travel typically account for more than 80 % of our carbon footprint , 57 we have made engaging with our travel-related suppliers a priority . Learn more about our supplier engagement in 2022 .\nInvestment in research and development ( R & D ) : We believe that the climate crisis is a defining issue of our time , so in 2021 , we committed to investing $ 1 billion in our capabilities over the next five years to help our clients lead a wave of innovation and growth to safeguard our planet .\nWe work with leading institutions to develop distinctive thought leadership and convene partnerships that tackle problems that institutions can not tackle alone . Operations : As a global firm , we have set 2025 validated SBTs and committed to net-zero climate impact by 2030 .\nEach region has an SBT regional leader ( senior partner level ) who is accountable for achieving our 2025 near-term SBTs to ensure we meet our commitments . Revenue : Climate change is leading companies to manage risks and seize opportunities , driving increased demand for management consultancy and advisory services on sustainability .\nThis increased demand for our expertise has a positive impact on our client service and revenue . The impact is currently moderate and is expected to increase in line with the global transition to a low-carbon economy , although it has not been deemed to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm . This is evaluated in short-term financial planning .\nWe are actively engaged with this challenge every day . In 2022 , 3,500+ colleagues partnered with 600+ clients on 1,600+ sustainability-related client engagements across nearly 60 countries . Assets : As an advisory firm , our `` assets '' are not physical locations or business units in the traditional sense , but our proprietary knowledge and our reputation .\nWe continue to make a substantial investment in research and knowledge building . This is factored into our financial planning , in developing an understanding of a wide range of sustainability and resource productivity topics with the investment in research and knowledge building .\nThis is factored into our financial planning , in developing an understanding of a wide range of sustainability and resource productivity topics with the aim of informing and progressing the debate with an independent fact base , tools and frameworks , and analysis of risks and opportunities .\nThe impact of these activities is low in comparison to the company-wide financial planning process and has not been deemed to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm in the short term . Capital expenditure : We have committed to 2025 SBTs and net-zero climate impact by 2030 . We have also been carbon neutral since 2018 .\nTherefore , capital expenditures and investments in energy-efficient buildings are included in the financial planning process . Acquisitions and divestments : McKinsey acquired Sweden-based Material Economics , experts in sustainability and circularity in December 2021 . In March 2021 , McKinsey acquired Vivid Economics and Planetrics to help clients navigate climate change , bringing us significant additional analytical capabilities .\nc. Describe the resilience of the organization 's strategy , taking into consideration different climate-related taking into consideration scenarios , including a 2C or lower scenario ( C3.2 , C3.2a , C3.2b ) : McKinsey has developed a suite of climate risk analysis tools and capabilities that assisted in our climate scenario analysis : Climate Resilience Analytics is McKinsey 's core team of experts who analyze and generate insights from the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients .\nThe team works across nearly all sectors at McKinsey that are impacted by climate change , such as the public , energy , and financial sectors . being Vivid Economics is a strategic economics consultancy with broad sustainability and macroeconomics capabilities McKinsey acquired in 2021 .\nThe Planetrics team , part of McKinsey Sustainability , is a specialist in the design of climate-change risk and opportunity modeling at the level of regions , sectors , and assets .\nIn 2022 , a cross-functional team composed of McKinsey climate scientists , consultants , economists , leaders in the sustainability practice , and risk and finance professionals conducted climate-related scenario analysis to project the financial and strategic implications of evolving physical and transition impacts of our firm 's strategy and business model ( using 2021 data ) .\nOur choice of climate scenarios weighed alignment to temperature pathways and policy actions .\nThese scenarios were assessed across multiple timeframes to capture near- , medium- , and long-term impacts Parameters and assumptions used in our climate-related scenario analysis depending on temperature alignment of scenario included : - The 1.5 C scenario , which uses UNPRI 's Inevitable Policy Response 'Required Policy Scenario '' capping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by 2100 .\nIt quantifies strong impacts transitional risks ( for example , carbon prices ) and innovation , and is included to reflect the net-zero pathway many governments and companies have publicly committed to . from - forceful policy in response to climate change and related implications for energy , vehicles , and carbon prices .\nResults of the climate-related scenario analysis : Cost of emissions change : Based on evolving carbon prices globally , carbon emissions likely to become increasingly expensive over time . Our scenario analysis included three point-in-time calculations in 2025 , 2030 , and 2050 . The main source of these emissions is business travel ( approximately 80 % of firm emissions in 2019 ) .\nAs part of our analysis , forecasted carbon prices from UNPRI 's `` Required Policy Scenario '' were weighted across geographies based on our emissions .\nAccording to UNPRI 's , 'Required Policy Scenario '' , carbon prices of $ 45-85 per ton and $ 87-175 per ton will be needed by 2030 and 2050 respectively : Carbon pricing from regulations are not likely to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business as we do not operate in an emissions-intensive industry and we have committed to reaching net zero by 2030 .\nPeople and physical assets most exposed : As a global firm that operates in 65+ countries , we have offices that are likely to be exposed to both acute and chronic physical risks in the near , colleagues are based in metropolitan areas that may be exposed to severe flooding globally and approximately 12.5K to hurricanes , especially in the Eastern US and Western Pacific .\nDespite these business- Effect on sectors we serve : We work with clients across sectors , sizes , and geographies . To assess the climate transition and physical impacts on the companies we serve , we conducted scenario analysis using Planetrics , our climate analytics suite .\nanalysis evaluated the impacts of decarbonization on the average valuations of companies in the sectors and regional industries that we serve The analysis included three scenarios : the Required Policy Response ( to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100 ) , the Forecasted Policy Response to limit and in helping grow new green industries help our clients identify opportunities and take bold action ."

        "comment": " The paragraph reasonably well addresses the disclosure by providing information on the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks, including integration into firmwide risk management, annual risk assessment, monitoring, and situational identification. It also mentions the factors considered for materiality determination and provides examples of responses. However, it lacks specific details on the incident investigation process and may benefit from more explicit information in this area. The materiality score is high as the paragraph clearly demonstrates the importance of climate risk identification to the business and stakeholders, aligning with revenue impact, client",

                "text": "a . Describe the organization 's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks ( C2.1 , C2.2 , C2.2a ) : Identification : Climate risk identification is integrated into firmwide risk management through our annual risk assessment , year-round monitoring , and situational identification . Outputs are taken into consideration as we define operational resilience requirements and actions .\nRisk and opportunity identification is embedded within our `` cells '' ( geographic offices , industry practices , functional practices , and growth platforms ) , which are most similar to the traditional meaning of `` assets '' within an organization .\nSpecifically , the partners of the firm who lead each geographic office are responsible for identifying and evaluating risks , including climate-related risks , arising from the operations of their local offices . With support from the broader firm , they work through local operating committees and management teams .\nIn a top-down approach , an internal working team of sustainability experts identifies climate-related transition risks across all climate-related risk categories based on current sources of emissions , regulatory and standards research , and interviews with colleagues across the firm . Assessment : Our collective risk management functions are overseen by our chief risk officer .\nThe risk management functions routinely and systematically undertake risk assessments , which include climate where relevant . These reviews incorporate diverse qualitative and quantitative inputs as well as external benchmarks and third-party verification of emissions to produce a comprehensive view of risk . They also inform the integration of cross-cutting risk mitigation work across McKinsey .\nWe prioritize management of our climate-related risks and opportunities based on their materiality to McKinsey at a firmwide level and at an organizational cluster level . b . Describe the organization 's processes for managing climate-related risks ( C2.1 , C2.2 ) : Our response to climate risk is unique to the risk type and materiality .\nResponses may be executed by internal functions as well as local managing partners or McKinsey Security , supported and reviewed by our risk management function . Any physical security risk to the well-being of our colleagues takes precedence over any other risk .\nMateriality is determined by a combination of factors , such as the ability to impact 4 % of firm revenue , client relationships , and the ability to attract and retain colleagues . Examples of responses include documented guidance for extreme weather , scenario training for local security coordinators and leadership , and reviews of our physical premises .\nc. Describe how processes for identifying , assessing , and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization \u2019 s overall risk management ( C2.1 , C2.2 ) : We identify , assess , and respond to climate risks across our direct operations through a risk management process that is integrated into our multidisciplinary company-wide risk management process .\nWe complete these assessments more than once a year , and look at short- , medium- , and long-term horizons . Central to our climate risk management is our risk framework , which provides the insight , integration , and technology we need to anticipate and proactively address risks .\nWe are in the process of enhancing our climate risk identification and assessment capabilities , for example , with the recent incorporation of more advanced scenario analysis into our climate reporting . We continually seek ways to better identify , analyze , and mitigate risk .\nProviding strategic direction for the management of climate-related risks is our Shareholders \u2019 Council , akin to a board of directors ."
