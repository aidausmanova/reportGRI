    "title": "Why it matters",
    "text": "Health should not be determined by who you are, where you live or where you were born.We are working to remove barriers to healthcare and give everyone the chance to be as healthy as possible.Economic and supply barriers, as well as geographic impediments, inhibit universal access to high quality, evidence-based healthcare.Additionally, in developing countries there is an epidemiological shift from the prevalence of communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), however local healthcare provision varies in quality and the systems may not be in place to tackle this growing burden.Programmes to control priority public health conditions also need to recognise the importance of the economic and social determinants of health.We are committed to addressing barriers to access and affordability.Our industry, policymakers and payers need to work together to identify solutions.Through collaborations, partnerships and stakeholder coalitions we are working to ensure essential and innovative medicines become more widely available.As a global business, there are challenges that affect our flexibility to provide access to our medicines.These include pricing controls, reimbursement mechanisms, taxation and mark-up systems, plus a high frequency of regulatory changes.In addition, supply chain complexity can increase costs, and the economic downturn is adversely affecting ability to pay (where applicable).While we are thoughtful in our pricing approach, we understand the challenges that healthcare systems and patients face in terms of equity and affordability.Recognising our shared responsibility, we take a broad, flexible approach to pricing to reflect the variation in healthcare systems.We are committed to working in partnership with patients, policymakers, payers and the wider healthcare community to ensure access is as equitable, widespread and as sustainable as possible.The shifting burden of disease, geopolitical fragmentation and the frequency of extreme weather events linked to the climate emergency all put pressure on health systems.The COVID-19 pandemic tested health systems' ability to respond to sudden shocks and crises while ensuring continuous access to healthcare services for patients.Health system capacity remains under pressure at global, regional and local levels, with outbreaks of infectious diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, as well as the increasing prevalence of NCDs, exacerbated by the growing impacts of climate change and ecosystem degradation on human health.Health system resilience and capacity must be strengthened.People and the planet will benefit from those medicines which have the smallest possible environmental impact yet maintain the highest medical efficacy and safety standards.As technologies and healthcare systems evolve, so should solutions to reduce energy, water, material use, waste and pollution generated from designing, manufacturing and delivering medicines to patients.We know that the GHG emissions from our product value chains are the most significant contribution to our company Scope 3 emissions, and we are addressing these across our business using a data-driven approach.Pharmaceuticals enter the environment mainly from patient use, where some can pass through our bodies and into waterways.APIs are biologically active molecules and may interact with and impact wildlife when in the environment.Drug manufacture and the improper disposal of unused medicines can also add to the trace levels of pharmaceuticals in rivers, lakes, soils, and sometimes drinking water.We recognise that, even in very low concentrations, the risks associated with Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PIE) should be determined and managed.With increased access to medicines worldwide and an ageing population, potentially more patients will pass pharmaceutical residues into the environment.More details of our approach can be found in our position statement on Pharmaceuticals in the Environment (PIE).We recognise that a healthy environment is inextricably linked to the health of people and society, and we need to operate within our planetary boundaries for a healthy planet.We are taking action to protect and restore ecosystems by limiting environmental impacts across our value chain, investing in nature and water stewardship, and protecting biodiversity on and around our sites.The conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and the protection and restoration of ecosystems are vital to shape a healthy future with resilient people and communities, building harmony between society and the natural environment.Supply chains from the pharmaceutical sector are highly complex, making it difficult to define our impacts and dependencies on nature and prioritise mitigating actions, especially because local conditions often necessitate unique solutions for shared challenges.Many materials needed to produce medicines are hazardous in nature and difficult to replace, generating waste streams that are challenging to reuse, recycle or repurpose.These factors mean cross-sectoral collaboration with suppliers, regulators, and other companies and organisations are needed to address the growing threats and changes to local ecosystems that our business relies upon.An ethical business culture is essential to successful risk management, and we are committed to increasing public trust in our industry.Recently, Norway, Canada and Germany have implemented legislation mandating human rights due diligence and greater transparency.The EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive also requires companies to consider social and environmental impacts, with a focus on transparency.This new legislation will require additional reporting on our supply chain.We do the right thingWe are entrepreneurialThe expanded interest in and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) creates opportunities for improved patient engagement and data analysis but also increases data privacy and data use concerns.We must ensure that we meet regulatory and stakeholder expectations around responsible use of AI, as well as data protection and security in this evolving environment, achieved through our Global Privacy Standard, our Global Standard on the Ethical Use of AI and our internal data and AI governance committees.grounds, including disability.The Code and its supporting Standards cover recruitment and selection, performance management, career development and promotion, transfer, training (including, if needed, for people who have become disabled), and reward.AstraZeneca embraces the cognitive differences of neurodivergent employees and supports employees with both seen and unseen disabilities in line with their countryspecific laws and regulations.Where risk assessments can be performed, we will consider accommodating adjustments to the working environment that support an inclusive and safe workplace.Our Global Standard for Inclusion and Diversity sets out how we foster an inclusive and diverse workforce where everyone feels valued and respected because of their individual abilities and perspectives.We believe that inclusion is a right and diversity is a strength.Both make a fundamental contribution to the success of our Company because innovation requires breakthrough ideas that only come from a diverse workforce empowered to challenge conventional thinking.Our ongoing commitment to I&amp;D underpins our ability to maintain a sustainable workforce by ensuring that we continue to attract, develop and retain top talent from various backgrounds and with different experiences.Every component of our I&amp;D mission is critical to our success.To continue to deliver medicines to patients, we must foster an environment where people feel safe, energised and inspired.The resources we put into supporting the physical and mental health and safety of our workforce are an investment in society at large, the communities where we operate and theirlong-term economic health.Contributing to a safe and healthy environment is the right thing to do and can also have positive business impacts in terms of productivity.",
